<h2 id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>The following pages give some account of
those actresses who stand out today as the most
interesting to an English-speaking reader. The
Continental actresses included are those who
gained international reputations and belonged
to the English and American stage almost as
much as to their own.</p>

<p>All actresses have been modern, in a sense,
for the acting of female rôles by women is distinctly
a latter-day touch in that ancient institution,
the theatre.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Thus a book on modern
actresses might range from Elizabeth Barry to
Mrs. Fiske. But while many volumes already
exist that serve well to keep alive the names of
the dead-and-gone heroines,<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> biographies of
actresses whom we of today have seen, are, in
general, insufficient or inaccessible. That is
true even of such notable women as Sarah Bernhardt,
Ada Rehan and Mrs. Fiske; while accounts
in English of such Continental actresses<span class="pagenum" id="Page_vi">vi</span>
as Duse and Réjane are altogether lacking.
The author hopes that in these chapters he has
done something toward making better known
the careers of those actresses and of others who
present themselves either in vivid recollection
or in the light of present day achievement.
The concluding chapter deals briefly with a number
of American actresses of the present, who,
although not rising in all cases to the eminence
or popularity attained by those to whom separate
chapters are given, yet have made some
distinct contribution to our stage.</p>

F. Edgett for the loan of material; to Mr. John
Bouvé Clapp and to Mr. Robert Gould Shaw

of the illustrations were made; and, for assistance
of many kinds, to the editor of the

<p class="drop-cap it"><i><span class="smcap1">“Sarah-Bernhardt</span>, Officier d’Académie,
artiste dramatique, directrice du
théâtre Sarah-Bernhardt, professeur au
Conservatoire</i>;” so run the rapid phrases of the
French “Who’s Who.” And, it might have
added: “personality extraordinary, and woman
of mystery.”</p>

<p>“The impetuous feminine hand that wields
scepter, thyrsus, dagger, fan, sword, bauble,
banner, sculptor’s chisel and horsewhip—it is
overwhelming.” Thus the poet Rostand epitomized
“the divine Sarah.” Her career, he said,
gives one the vertigo—it is one of the marvels
of the nineteenth century. And he might have
added, of the twentieth, for Bernhardt, who began
her stage career at the time of our Civil
War, was only recently, at an amazing age, to
be seen on the stage of London and Paris.
There are many who think, with William Winter,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a>
that she has been merely “an accomplished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
executant, an experienced, expert imitator,
within somewhat narrow limits, of the operations
of human passion and human suffering.”
The fact remains, the woman has been a genius
of work and achievement, “the Lady of
Energy,” who has fairly earned the title of
great actress. It is difficult to think of any
woman the light of whose fame has carried to
the ends of the earth in quite the same way.
To be sure it has not always been from the lamp
of pure genius. There have been self-advertising,
scandal, extravagant eccentricity, to swell
the general effect, but back of all this has been
the worker.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
She was born in Paris, at 265 <i>Rue St. Honoré</i>,
October 23, 1844.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Her blood is a mingling
of French and Dutch-Jewish. Her real
name is Rosine Bernard, and she was the
eleventh of fourteen children. Of her father<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
hardly anything can be learned. Sarah herself
says that when she was still a mere baby he
had gone to China, but why he went there she
had no idea. Her mother was, by birth, a
Dutch Jewess, by sympathy a Frenchwoman, by
habit a cosmopolitan; “a wandering beauty of
Israel,” forever traveling. As much because
there was no home, therefore, as because
the French have a custom of banishing infants
from the household, Sarah spent her
childhood in the care of a foster-mother, first in
the Breton country, near Quimperlé (where
she fell in the fireplace and was badly burned),
then at Neuilly, near Paris. Her mother came
seldom to see her, though there seems to have
been affection, at least on the child’s side. It
was a lonely childhood—made worse by the
high-strung, sensitive nature that was Sarah’s
from the beginning.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

<p>When Sarah was seven she was sent away to
boarding school at Auteuil, where she says she
spent two comparatively happy years. Her
mysterious father then sent orders that she was
to be transferred to a convent. “The idea that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
I was to be ordered about without any regard
to my own wishes or inclinations put me into
an indescribable rage. I rolled about on the
ground, uttering the most heartrending cries.
I yelled out all kinds of reproaches, blaming
mamma, my aunts, and Mme. Fressard for not
finding some way to keep me with her. The
struggle lasted two hours, and while I was being
dressed I escaped twice into the garden and attempted
to climb the trees and throw myself
into the pond, in which there was more mud
than water. Finally, when I was completely
exhausted and subdued, I was taken off sobbing
in my aunt’s carriage.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

<p>At the Augustinian convent at Grandchamp,
Versailles, she was baptized and confirmed a
Christian. She became extravagantly pious
and conceived a passionate adoration of the
Virgin. Nevertheless, she was fractious and
was more than once expelled.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
When she left the convent Sarah was a
capricious, sensitive, religious girl, who must
indeed have constituted a problem for her
mother. Sarah, strangely enough, was herself
strongly inclined to be a nun. But her mother,
who was a woman of the world and of means,
had other plans and provided as “finishing governess”
for Sarah a Mlle. de Brabander. One
day, when she was fifteen, her fate was decided
for her. At a family council her own ambition
to be a nun was voted down and the decision
was: “Send her to the <i>Conservatoire</i>.”
Sarah had never even heard of the famous
school for actors of the government theatres.
That same evening she was taken to the theatre
for the first time—the <i>Théâtre Français</i>. <i>Brittanicus</i>
and <i>Amphitrion</i> moved her profoundly,
and she left the theatre weeping, as much for
the sudden shattering of her cherished plan as
from the effects of the plays.</p>

<p>Thus she began her studies at the <i>Conservatoire</i>
(1860) with no love for the career chosen
for her.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> She was no beauty;—she was decidedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
thin, had kinky hair, and a pale face. But
she worked hard. Her extraordinary nervous
energy and her intelligence had their effect and
when she left the <i>Conservatoire</i> she had won
two second prizes.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> The discernment of some
of the judges<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> saw in her something of the artist
she was to be, and she immediately had a
call to the company of the <i>Comédie Française</i>.
With the signing of her contract came her resolve,
that if the stage were to be her working
place, she would throw herself into her task
with all her soul. “<i>Quand-même</i>,”—in spite of
all,—was already her motto,—she would, in the
face of any obstacle, win a place for herself.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></p>

<p>Though with wonderful success she has been
busily pursuing that object from that day to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
this, the beginnings of her career were not
promising. Her début (1862) in Racine’s
<i>Iphigénie</i> created no particular comment. She
remembers, however, that on that occasion,
when she lifted her long and extraordinarily
thin arms, for the sacrifice, the audience
laughed.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Other parts fell to her, but she did
not long remain at the House of Molière. As
other managers were later to learn, Sarah cared
little for agreements and contracts.</p>

<p>The occasion of her first desertion of the
<i>Comédie</i> was trivial enough. Here at the great
national theatre she expected to remain always,
but one day her sister trod on the gown of Mme.
Nathalie, another actress of the company, “old,
spiteful and surly,” who in petty anger shoved
the girl aside. Sarah promptly responded by
boxing the ears of her elder colleague. Neither
would apologize, and the quickly achieved result
was that the younger actress retired.</p>

<p>She remained away from the <i>Comédie Française</i>
for ten years, and it was during this time
that she laid the foundation of her fame. Brief
engagements at the <i>Gymnase</i><a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> and the <i>Porte<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
St. Martin</i> were followed by an opportunity to
join the company at the <i>Odéon</i>. MM. Chilly
and Duquesnel were the managers. The latter
was young, kind to Sarah, and discerning of
her talents. As for Chilly, he was less enthusiastic:
“M. Duquesnel is responsible for you.
I should not upon any account have engaged
you.”</p>

<p>“And if you had been alone, monsieur,” she
answered, “I should not have signed, so we are
quits.”</p>

<p>Mlle. Bernhardt’s career—once she had
launched herself upon it—divides naturally
into three periods: the six years (1866–1872) at
the <i>Odéon</i>, the playhouse of the Latin Quarter,
“the theatre,” she says, “that I have loved
most”; another term (1872–1880) at the <i>Française</i>; and
her long career since, during which
she has been her own mistress, accepting engagements
where it pleased her, managing
theatres of her own, and traveling over all the
world.</p>

<p>Her first taste of success came when she
played Zacharie in <i>Athalie</i>, soon after she went
to the <i>Odéon</i>. It fell to her to recite the
choruses, and the “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voix d’or</i>” won its first
triumph. She was now twenty-two. For four
years, with plentiful interludes of temper and
temperament, she had been striving for success.
Now, at the <i>Odéon</i>, she worked and worked
hard. “I was always ready to take any one’s
place at a moment’s notice, for I knew all the
rôles.” Chilly, who at first could see only her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
thinness<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> and not her ability, was brought
round to Duquesnel’s view of her. “I used to
think,” she says again, “of my few months at
the <i>Comédie Française</i>. The little world I had
known there had been stiff, scandal-mongering,
and jealous. At the <i>Odéon</i> I was very happy.
We thought of nothing but putting on plays,
and we rehearsed morning, afternoon, and at
all hours, and I liked that very much.”<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>At the <i>Odéon</i> Sarah soon became the favorite
of the students of the <i>Quartier</i>. Rather to the
disgust of the older patrons of the house, the
students were indiscriminate in their appreciation
of the young actress, and applauded
her indifferent work equally with her successes.</p>

<p>For successes she now began to have. With
difficulty M. Chilly was induced to consent to
the production of Coppée’s one-act play <i>Le
Passant</i>. But so successful was it that it not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
only ran for a hundred nights, but Bernhardt
and the beautiful Mlle. Agar played it for Napoleon
and Eugénie at the Tuileries. In <i>Kean</i>,
by Dumas, she was, by all accounts, admirable.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a></p>

<p>George Sand came to the <i>Odéon</i> for the rehearsals
of her play <i>L’Autre</i>. Of her Bernhardt
says: “Mme. George Sand was a sweet
charming creature, extremely timid. She did
not talk much but smoked all the time.”</p>

<p>In the midst of her term at the <i>Odéon</i> came
an astonishing episode in Bernhardt’s career—her
activities during the Franco-Prussian War
of 1870–71. The theatres were of course closed,
but it was not in her nature to sit still and do
nothing. Therefore she sent her young son<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>
out of the city, and in the fall of 1870, after her
own severe illness, proceeded to establish an
army hospital in the foyers of the <i>Odéon</i>, with
herself as its working head. With an executive
ability and a zeal characteristic but none
the less remarkable, she not only organized its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
commissariat, and kept all the records and accounts,
but herself acted as one of the nurses.
The section of her autobiography that deals
with the siege of Paris and with her journey
through the enemy’s country to Hombourg and
back that she might bring home her family, will
afford some future historian a graphic impression
of one of the saddest days in the history of
Paris.</p>

<p>When the <i>Odéon</i> reopened, in the fall of 1871,
Sarcey, the great critic, said of Sarah, who
played (in <i>Jean-Marie</i>) a young Breton girl:
“No one could be more innocently poetic than
this young lady. She will become a great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>,
and she is already an admirable artist.
Everything she does has a special savor of its
own. It is impossible to say whether she is
pretty. She is thin, and her expression is sad,
but she has queenly grace, charm, and the inexpressible
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">je ne sais quoi</i>. She is an artist by
nature, and an incomparable one. There is no
one like her at the <i>Comédie Française</i>.”</p>

<p>At the end of 1871 Victor Hugo, who had been
practically an exile during the Empire, came
back to France. His return, as it proved,
meant another turning point in Sarah’s life, for
when the <i>Odéon</i> decided to produce his <i>Ruy
Blas</i>, she was selected, after a good deal of
bickering, as the Queen. Hugo she found, despite
her strong previous prejudice against him,
“charming, so witty and refined, and so gallant.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
The play was produced on January 26, 1872.
That night, in Bernhardt’s own words, “rent
asunder the thin veil which still made my
future hazy, and I felt that I was destined for
celebrity. Until that day I had remained the
students’ little Fairy. I became then the elect
of the Public.” Hugo himself, on his knee,
kissed her hands and thanked her. M. Sarcey,
who from the beginning was Bernhardt’s
staunchest admirer among the critics, praised
her warmly: “No rôle was ever better adapted
to Mlle. Bernhardt’s talents. She possesses the
gift of resigned and patient dignity. Her diction
is so wonderfully clear and distinct that
not a syllable is missed.”</p>

<p>The <i>Comédie Française</i> now made overtures
for her return to its fold. Bernhardt at once<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
accepted, which was wretchedly unfair to the
<i>Odéon</i>, for she owed much to Duquesnel. When
in 1866 he persuaded Chilly to take her on, she
was comparatively unknown; now, in 1872, she
was rapidly becoming the talk of Paris. Her
contract with the <i>Odéon</i> had yet a year to run,
but Sarah demanded, as the condition of her
remaining, an advance in the stipulated
salary.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Chilly indignantly refused; so Mlle.
Bernhardt hurried away to the <i>Comédie</i> and
forthwith signed her new contract. The <i>Odéon</i>
brought an action against her and she had to
pay a forfeit of six thousand francs.</p>

<p>This sudden change of scene is but one instance
of the directness, not to say unscrupulousness,
of Bernhardt’s methods in advancing
herself. “<i>Quand-même</i>” it was to be, at any
cost. If she had merely followed her inclinations,
however, she would probably have remained
at the <i>Odéon</i>, for she has often protested
the attraction for her of the scene of her
first triumphs. The <i>Comédie</i>, on the other
hand, had never this appeal to her. As is easily
understood, her imperiousness and willfulness
made her feel less at home at the more staid
<i>Comédie</i>. The other members of her company,
with a few exceptions, were unfriendly and jealous.
Moreover she made almost a failure in
her début (in <i>Mlle. de Belle-Isle</i>), but this was
due not to stage-fright, as Sarcey guessed, but
to her anxiety on seeing her mother, suddenly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
taken ill, leave the theatre. Sarcey loyally
championed her early efforts, though he was
often keenly critical also: “I fear,” he wrote
(apropos of <i>Dalila</i>), “that the management has
made a mistake in already giving Mlle. Sarah
Bernhardt leading parts. I do not know
whether she will ever be able to fill them, but
she certainly cannot do so at present. She is
wanting in power and breadth of conception.
She impersonates soft and gentle characters
admirably, but her failings become manifest
when the whole burden of the piece rests on her
fair shoulders.” Other critics, particularly
Paul de Saint-Victor, were consistently hostile.
She had in the company envious rivals who inspired
attacks on her, and she clashed frequently
with M. Perrin, the director of the theatre.
With that indomitable persistence that is
her finest trait, however, she kept right on, and
won her way to genuine achievement. As Aricie
in <i>Phèdre</i> she made a secondary part notable.
Thus Sarcey: “There can be no doubt
about it now. All the opposition to Mlle. Bernhardt
must yield to facts. She simply delighted
the public. The beautiful verses
allotted to Aricie were never better delivered.
Her voice is genuine music. There was a continuous
thrill of pleasure among the entire audience.”</p>

<p>That she had thoroughly arrived was soon
to be proved and re-proved. Zaïre<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> was followed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
by Phèdre herself, Berthe in <i>La Fille de
Roland</i>, Doña Sol in <i>Hernani</i>, Monime in <i>Mithridate</i>,
and revivals of <i>Ruy Blas</i> and <i>Le Sphinx</i>,
each a personal triumph for the actress who
was so rapidly filling the eye of Paris.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<p>For Sarah Bernhardt had by now succeeded
in making herself, if not a universally acknowledged
artist, at least a real Parisian celebrity.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
It was not a reputation confined to the actress
<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">per se</i>. Designedly or not, Sarah set the
tongues of Paris (and shortly of all Europe)
wagging by a continuous exhibition of eccentricity
that amounts to a tradition. To mention
only what seem to be well authenticated
manifestations of her caprice: She kept a
pearwood coffin at the foot of her bed, slept in
it and learned her parts in it. It is to be the
veritable coffin of her last resting place.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> She
kept as a further reminder of her mortality a
complete human skeleton in her bedroom.
Years before she had a tortoise as a household
pet. She named it Chrysogère and had a shell
of gold, set with topazes, fitted to its back.
Now she was keeping two Russian greyhounds,
a poodle, a bulldog, a terrier, a leveret, a monkey,
three cats, a parrot, and several other birds.
Later she had lions, and an alligator! She
made ascents in a captive balloon at the Exhibition
and once in a balloon that was <em>not</em> captive.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a>
Perrin was outraged by this caprice
and tried to fine her for “traveling without
leave.” She wrote for the newspapers. She
scorned the fashions. She dabbled in painting
and sculpture, and, particularly with her chisel,
her efforts were, if not noteworthy, at least respectable.
Indeed, a group sculpture won an
honorable mention in the Salon of 1876, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
there were plenty to deny that it was really her
work. Her studiolike apartment was the rendezvous
of all artistic Paris.</p>

<p>In 1879 her poetic, restrained, and generally
admirable impersonation of Doña Sol in <i>Hernani</i>
brought her general homage. On the
night of the one-hundredth performance Victor
Hugo presided at a banquet in her honor, and
M. Sarcey, in behalf of her “many admiring
friends,” presented to her a necklace of diamonds.</p>

<p>When it was proposed, in 1879, that the
<i>Comédie Française</i> company go to London,
Sarah refused to go along unless she be made
Associate “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à parte entière</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> Her proposal
was rejected, and at a meeting of the Committee
M. Got represented the feeling that prevailed
among the directors of the theatre by
crying: “Well, let her stay away! She is a
regular nuisance!” Sarah finally gave in,
however, and in reward was made “<i>Sociétaire
à parte entière</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
On the first evening at the Gaiety, Bernhardt
was to make her bow to England in the second
act of <i>Phèdre</i>. Just before she went on she had
one of her occasional bad attacks of stage
fright, and could not remember her lines.
“When I began my part,” she wrote, “as I had
lost my self-possession, I started on rather too
high a note, and when once in full swing I
could not get lower again; I simply could not
stop. I suffered, I wept, I implored, I cried
out, and it was all real. My suffering was horrible.”
<i>The Telegraph</i> next morning said:
“Clearly Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt exerted every
nerve and fiber and her passion grew with the
excitement of the spectators, for when after a
recall that could not be resisted the curtain
drew up, Mr. Mounet-Sully was seen supporting
the exhausted figure of the actress, who had
won her triumph only after tremendous physical
exertion, and triumph it was, however short
and sudden.”</p>

<p>An American writer—probably Henry James—said
at this time in the <i>Nation</i>: “It would
require some ingenuity to give an idea of the
intensity, the ecstasy, the insanity, as some people
would say, of curiosity and enthusiasm provoked
by Mlle. Bernhardt.... She is not, to
my sense, a celebrity because she is an artist.
She is a celebrity because, apparently, she desires,
with an intensity that has rarely been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
equaled, to be one, and because all ends are
alike to her.... She has compassed her ends
with a completeness which makes of her a sort
of fantastically impertinent <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">victrix</i> poised upon
a perfect pyramid of ruins—the ruins of a hundred
British prejudices and proprieties....
The trade of a celebrity, pure and simple, had
been invented, I think, before she came to London;
if it had not been, it is certain that she
would have discovered it. She has in a supreme
degree what the French call the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">génie
de la réclame</i>—the advertising genius; she
may, indeed, be called the muse of the newspaper.”</p>

<p>But trouble was brewing, and the irrepressible
Sarah was soon making difficulties for her
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrères</i>. She insisted on her right to give
performances before private audiences on the
nights she was not appearing with the company.
Perrin had flown into a rage when he first heard
of these performances, for it was the <i>Comédie’s</i>
chief grievance against her that she <em>would not</em>
rest. There came a day in London when Sarah
sent word she was too tired to appear. A Saturday
audience had to be dismissed at the last
moment; it was too late to change the bill. A
great commotion ensued among the company
and in the Paris press. So many and varied
were the attacks on her that she was on the
point of resignation. She had brought to London
a number of her sculptures and paintings
and gave an exhibition, selling a few pieces,
and entertaining at the gallery reception a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
group of aristocrats and celebrities—Gladstone
and Leighton among them. She made a trip to
Liverpool to buy more lions, and came back
with a chetah, a wolf, and a half dozen chameleons
to add to her menagerie. The members
of the company thought she was ruining the
dignity of “Molière’s House”; and all manner
of stories were told. “It was said,” she wrote,
“that for a shilling anyone might see me
dressed as a man; that I smoked huge cigars
leaning on the balcony of my house; that at the
various receptions when I gave one-act plays,
I took my maid with me for the dialogue; that
I practiced fencing in my garden, dressed as a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pierrot</i> in white, and that when taking boxing
lessons I had broken two teeth for my unfortunate
professor.” These stories were only less
dreadful than the tales told in Paris: that she
had thrown a live kitten into the fire, and poisoned
two monkeys with her own hands!</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, it is probable that Sarah
was finding irksome the restrictions of the
<i>Comédie</i>, was ambitious to earn more money
and, as anxious for her exit from the company
as were her jealous <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrères</i>, was only waiting
for a chance to sever her contract. But
contracts with the <i>Française</i> are not lightly
broken. As Coquelin had told her: “When
one has the good fortune and the honor of belonging
to the <i>Comédie Française</i> one must remain
there until the end of one’s career.” She
had to watch her chance shrewdly.</p>

<p>Again returned to Paris, the company of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
<i>Comédie</i> revived, on April 17, 1880, Augier’s
<i>L’Aventurière</i>. From whatever cause—pique
at being assigned a part she disliked in a play
she detested, a temporary suspension of her
usual power, or, as she says herself, illness that
prevented proper study of her part,—she failed
rather miserably. Even the usually indulgent
Sarcey said: “Her Clorinde was absolutely
colorless”; and the other critics, to a man,
wrote scathing reviews. Sarah saw her chance,
as she thought, and determined that this would
be her last performance at the <i>Comédie</i>. The
morning after the fiasco she wrote to Perrin:</p>

<blockquote>

<p class="in0 b0">“<i>Monsieur l’Administrateur</i>:</p>

<p class="p0">“You made me play before I was ready. You gave
me only eight stage rehearsals, and there were only
three full rehearsals of the piece. I could not make
up my mind to appear under such conditions, but you
insisted upon it. What I foresaw has come to pass,
and the result of the performance has even gone beyond
what I expected. One critic actually charges
me with playing Virginie in <i>L’Assommoir</i> instead of
<i>L’Aventurière</i>! May Emile Augier and Zola absolve
me! It is my first rebuff at the <i>Comédie</i>, and it shall
be my last. I warned you at the dress rehearsal.
You have gone too far. I now keep my word. When
you receive this letter I shall have left Paris. Be good
enough, Monsieur l’Administrateur, to accept my resignation
as from this moment.</p>

<p>
Apr. 18, 1880.      <span class="smcap in8">Sarah Bernhardt.</span>”
</p></blockquote>

<p>An immense commotion at once arose, as if
some tremendous political upheaval had occurred.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
Sarah took train and disappeared in
the country, just as on a similar occasion, years
before, she had suddenly gone off to Spain.
The press, her fellow players, and the author
of the play all poured upon her head a shower
of abuse. M. Sarcey prophesied: “She had
better not deceive herself. Her success will not
be lasting. She is not one of those <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artistes</i> who
can bear the whole weight of a piece on their
own shoulders, and who require no assistance
to hold the public attention.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> The <i>Comédie</i>
took legal action against her, and a few months
later, when the suit was tried, Sarah was formally
deprived of her standing as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sociétaire</i>, of
her portion of the reserve fund, amounting to
more than eight thousand dollars, and in addition
had to pay the <i>Française</i> damages of
twenty thousand dollars. She hadn’t the
money, but she soon earned it, on her first
American tour.</p>

<p>So ended, for good and all, Bernhardt’s connection
with the government theatres; so
abruptly did she turn a corner in her remarkable
career. From her retirement Sarah announced,
absurdly enough, that she would renounce
the stage, and live by painting and
sculpture, for these, she said, brought her
thirty thousand francs ($6,000) a year. As a
matter of fact, within two weeks she signed a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
contract with Henry E. Abbey, who post-haste
crossed the ocean for the purpose, to go to
America. His English agent, Jarrett, had long
been importuning her to go. Now she was glad
to accept.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>Sarah’s wanderings now began—those wanderings
that have carried her up and down the
world, made her name familiar everywhere,
brought her riches and (in William Winter’s
sonorous phrase) “such adulation and advocacy
as have seldom been awarded to even
the authentic benefactors of human society.”
First she played a month in London, giving the
pieces she was preparing for the American tour,
and scoring a tremendous success, artistic, financial
and social. A newspaper writer said at
this time: “It has been said here that English
society is not so eager this season to make her
a social goddess as it was last; but it would
hardly be possible for a woman to be more
thoroughly besieged than is Sarah—that is the
name by which people generally fondly call her.
To see her is almost as difficult as to see the
Queen—I dare say for people not connected
with the artistic world even more so. Sarah
lives very comfortably—even luxuriously—and
entertains lavishly. It seems to me that the
only lack of attention that she could possibly
complain of is that the Queen has not yet left
her card, and that is a complaint she must share
with many people.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
To her amazement the Paris critics followed
her to London, and praised her extravagantly.
Sarcey personally tried to induce her to return
to Paris, and M. Perrin sent Got, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">doyen</i> of
the <i>Comédie</i>, on the same errand. Sarah refused;
she was enjoying her freedom and her
large earnings. She went to Belgium and then
to Denmark. At Copenhagen she brought a
storm about her ears by a gratuitous affront to
the German Ambassador to Denmark, Baron
Magnus. At a dinner in her honor he gallantly
proposed a health to “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la belle France</i>.” Sarah
was at once on her feet, in a theatrical mood,
mindful of the smarts that lingered from the
war of 1870–1871, and much impressed with her
own importance. “I suppose, <i>Monsieur l’Embassadeur
de Prusse</i>,” she cried, “you mean
the <em>whole</em> of France.” This obvious reference
to Alsace-Lorraine put the amiable Baron to
confusion, broke up the dinner, threw consternation
into the French diplomats on duty in
Copenhagen, and enraged Bismarck. It is only
fair to say that Sarah was genuinely sorry for
her impetuous “break.”</p>

<p>Before sailing for America, Sarah was prevailed
upon to undertake a month’s provincial
tour in France—something she had never done.
She appeared in Nantes, Bordeaux, Toulouse,
Lyons and Geneva. Everywhere enthusiasm
for her ran high. “Medals bearing her image
and superscription, Sarah Bernhardt bracelets
and collars, photographs and biographies were
sold in the streets. At Lyons the Khedive’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
son unsuccessfully offered £80 for a stage-box.”<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<p>On October 16, 1880, Mlle. Bernhardt sailed
for New York. On November 8, at Booth’s
Theatre, she made her first appearance in America
in <i>Adrienne Lecouvreur</i>, which, with much
success, she had added to her repertoire since
leaving the <i>Comédie</i>.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> Her triumph was immediate.
She had been told that New York
would receive her coldly. At the end of the
play, however, “there was quite a manifestation
and everyone was deeply moved,” while
after the play a large crowd serenaded and
cheered before her hotel. Sarah had been put
on her mettle, and, as always, she did her best
in the face of possible opposition. And these
ovations repeated themselves in each city, both
in the United States and in Canada.</p>

<p>The Bishop of Montreal took it upon himself
to condemn Bernhardt, her company, her plays,
the authors and French literature in general.
As if in reply to his utterances, the public
flocked to see Sarah. As is usual with such
strictures, the Bishop had given the best possible<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
advertising<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> and each night Sarah’s
sleigh was dragged by cheering men.</p>

<p>Wherever she went, her astute managers saw
to it that the Bernhardtian advertising tradition
was maintained: She went to Menlo Park
to call on Thomas A. Edison; at Boston she
visited a captive live whale in the harbor, and
stood (and fell!) upon its back; in Canada she
visited a tribe of Iroquois; at Montreal she ventured
on the ice in the St. Lawrence and put
her life in peril; visiting the Colt factory at
Springfield, Massachusetts, she fired off some
newly invented cannon;—“it amused me very
much without procuring me any emotion,” she
wrote; at Chicago she witnessed the slaughtering
of pigs at the stock-yards; in St. Louis her
jewelry was exhibited in a store window; at
Niagara she again endangered her life by getting
herself into an awkward place on the ice
bridge below the falls.</p>

<p>Her object was accomplished, at all events.
She had won in America a new fame and a much
needed fortune. She had earned more than one
hundred and eighty thousand dollars. She was
now able to pay her debt to the <i>Française</i>, and
had a comfortable sum left. And her return
to France was a veritable return from Elba.
Her vessel was met by scores of small boats,
gay with welcoming flags, and the wharves held<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
thousands of people shouting: “<i>Vive</i> Sarah
Bernhardt!” Her first performance in France
of <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, at Havre in May,
1881, was “a perfect triumph.”</p>

<p>It is startling to reflect that a woman who
thus reached the zenith of her career a generation
ago is still a working actress. What a
triumph for the frail physique and the dauntless
will! It is worth while to get a picture
of her at about the time of her American tour,
when she was thirty-six years old. A correspondent
who visited her in London wrote:
“I never was more agreeably disappointed in
the appearance of a person than when Sarah
smilingly and merrily tripped into the room.
She looked infinitely fresher, brighter and prettier
than I had ever seen her on the stage. Her
photographs are perfect caricatures—every one
of them. They give no idea of those wonderfully
clear, translucent, great blue eyes, with
their now soft and melting and now keen and
penetrating glance; of her fresh and fair complexion,
which on the stage is hidden under a
horrid mask of thick paint; of her beautiful
light blond hair, which lacks just a shade of
being golden and is curled in the most graceful
fashion; of her tender and sensitive mouth, the
slightest motion of which is full of character
and expression. I had never considered her
pretty. I now, after a most careful and painstaking
inspection, decidedly thought her so.
She was charmingly dressed, too, and her thinness
of person, which is so generally marked,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
but which she ridicules herself, was most artistically
disguised. The waves of lace and ruffles
which fell about her neck appeared to hide a
bust worthy of Diana herself.”</p>

<p>Other contemporary accounts show that those
who visited her at her studio found her clad
in a gray or white flannel suit of masculine garments,—jacket,
trousers, necktie and all, “looking
something like a thirteen-year-old boy.”
Though Sarah performed wonders in the way
of self-advertising, more than one observer has
noticed that she had a certain natural dignity
that was not altogether inconsistent with a
rather rollicking playfulness. “Her words are
those of a lady,” wrote one, “and her enunciation,
though rapid, beautifully distinct.” She
has always been eminently hospitable.</p>

<p>In the engaging phrase of one of her biographers,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a>
“Marriage was the only eccentricity
that Sarah had not yet perpetrated.” In the
spring of 1882 she remedied this deficiency by
marrying a member of her company, a Greek
named Damala, or, as he was known on the stage,
Daria. Sarah had been proceeding up and
down Europe (always patriotically excepting
Germany), playing in France, Holland, Belgium,
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Russia, Italy,
Austria and Spain, everywhere with immense
success.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> In the midst of this tour, quite unexpectedly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
(April, 1882), came the announcement
of the marriage. In order to have the
ceremony performed in London, she had traveled
from Naples, and then returned to Spain
to resume the tour.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> It was the talk of the day
that the reason for Sarah’s sudden marriage
and for the selection of London as the scene of
the ceremony, was not only her passing infatuation
for Damala, but also a wish to propitiate
English Puritanism. For a tour of England
and Scotland soon followed. The marriage was
not a huge success, however. It lasted not
more than a year.</p>

<p>The mere statement of Bernhardt’s wanderings
is sufficiently astonishing and is one proof
of her wonderful vitality. In 1886, a tour that
lasted more than a year took her to Mexico,
Brazil, Chile, the Argentine,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> the United States
and Canada. Two years later she acted in Constantinople,
Cairo and Alexandria, besides
most of the European countries. In the early
part of 1891 she left Europe for two years and
played not only in North and South America,
but this time as far afield as Australia. Sarah
has been a cosmopolitan figure, if there ever
was one. As the land of readily won dollars,
the United States has naturally been much
favored; for beginning in 1880, Bernhardt has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
made no less than nine tours in America.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<p>Like a number of actors of the other sex, but
almost alone among actresses, Bernhardt has
dabbled in the management of theatres. Soon
after her first American tour, she assumed control
of the <i>Ambigu</i> in Paris. If she had acted
in her own theatre (as later she did) her business
venture might have succeeded. As it was,
she was acting <i>Fédora</i> at the <i>Vaudeville</i>, and
later, with only moderate success, in Holland<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
and Belgium. The <i>Ambigu</i> languished. In the
meantime, Sarah had spent all her money.
Finding herself in straits, she auctioned her
jewels, and realized handsomely on them. It
was an event in Paris, and the sale produced
no less than thirty-five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Her next venture in management was more
successful. In 1883, on behalf of her son, she
bought a partnership in the <i>Porte St. Martin</i>,
and produced <i>Frou-Frou</i> there for the first time
in Paris. Her régime at this house was interrupted
by the long tour begun in 1886, but continued,
under the prosperity shed by her own
presence, until 1893, when she bought the <i>Renaissance</i>.
Since that day she has owned her
own theatre, until 1899 at the <i>Renaissance</i>, and
since then at the more commodious <i>Théâtre
Sarah-Bernhardt</i>, her renaming of the <i>Théâtre
des Nations</i>.</p>

<p>When Bernhardt went to America for the
first time she had in her company an actress
named Marie Colombier. For reasons that are
difficult to determine, this woman conceived a
passionate hatred of Sarah and on her return
to France prepared, or had prepared for her,<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>
a thinly disguised pseudo-biography of Bernhardt
which sold in enormous numbers under
the name <i>Les Memoires de Sarah Barnum</i>.
This pamphlet subjected Bernhardt to miscellaneous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
ridicule and abuse. Although on the
whole false, parts of it may have been true
enough to penetrate the armor against gossip
that Sarah schooled herself to wear. At any
rate, she was furiously angry. When the book
had been in circulation long enough to give her
action its proper background and advertising
value, Bernhardt one day turned up at Mme.
Colombier’s apartment, accompanied by her son
and M. Jean Richepin, and armed with a horsewhip.
The party forced themselves in, and
Sarah, great actress, proceeded to chase her detractor
about the place, beating her soundly
with the whip. A similar incident occurred at
Rio de Janeiro in 1886. Mme. Noirmont, a
member of the company, one day “went for”
Sarah with strong language and the flat of her
hand. Sarah was at first content with the
woman’s arrest, but one evening, between the
acts, her desire for revenge got the better of
her, and Mme. Noirmont was, in her turn, thoroughly
horsewhipped. The cause of these (at
the time) world famous ructions, which are now
important only—if at all—as shedding light on
Sarah’s frail humanity, has always remained
shrouded in mystery.</p>

<p>Further proof that the “divine Sarah” was
after all very human was furnished in 1907
when she published a volume of reminiscences.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a>
William Winter’s estimate of this book is characteristic;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
it contains, he says: “some passages
of interest, but, as a whole, it is diffuse, flamboyant,
and artificial,—an eccentric contribution
to theatrical annals, mottled over by affectation,
egregious vanity, and the pervasive insincerity
of an inveterate self-exploiter.” It
would be juster to say that the book shows in
many places a more likable woman than the
eccentric celebrity was supposed to be, and that
it contains but few passages that are <em>not</em> of interest.
At any rate, it shows Sarah to be, after
all, in many respects like us commonplace
people.</p>

<p>Whatever hostility she may have met in her
earlier days, Bernhardt long ago won the unqualified
homage of her countrymen. To them
she became a cherished national institution, the
great actress of her time. “The great and only
Sarah” is the phrase of the once scoffing Sarcey.
“I am not quite sure,” wrote Lemaître
in 1894, “whether Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt can
say ‘How do you do?’ like any ordinary mortal.
To be herself she must be extraordinary, and
then she is incomparable.” “You cannot praise
her for reciting poetry well,” said M. Theodore
de Banville, a poet learned in metres and
rhythms; “she is the muse of poetry itself.
A secret instinct moves her. She recites poetry
as the nightingale sings, as the wind sighs, and
as the water murmurs.”</p>

<p>“Her acting is the summit of art,”—again
Sarcey—“our grandfathers used to speak with
emotion of Talma and Mlle. Mars. I never saw<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
either the one or the other, and I have barely
any recollection of Rachel, but I do not believe
that anything more original and more perfect
than Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt’s <i>Phèdre</i> has ever
been seen in any theatre.”</p>

<p>To take this view of Sarah one must, perhaps,
be a Frenchman. The Sarcey of America, William
Winter, certainly could not take it. With
what may be termed the utilitarian Puritanism
that seeks in the theatre to be “benefited,
cheered, encouraged, ennobled, instructed, or
even rationally entertained,” he could see in
Bernhardt’s art only an exhibition of morbid
eccentricity. Mr. Winter, here as elsewhere,
has been made intolerant of much in the institution
he has served and honored by his insistence
on “intrinsic grandeur” in its characters. He
is always looking for “the woman essentially
good and noble,” whereas the modern drama
has as one of its most cherished prerogatives
its right to portray mixed characters,—often
women whose “essential goodness” is mingled
with much human frailty.</p>

<p>Fairly enough, however, according to his
lights, does Mr. Winter specify and define Bernhardt’s
peculiar merits: “They are, in brief,
the ability to elicit complete and decisive dramatic
effect from situations of horror, terror,
vehement passion, and mental anguish; neatness
in the adjustment of manifold details;
evenly sustained continuity; ability to show a
woman who seeks to cause physical infatuation
and who generally can succeed in doing so; a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
woman in whom vanity, cruelty, selfishness, and
animal propensity are supreme; a woman of
formidable, sometimes dangerous, sometimes
terrible mental force.”</p>

<p>Not all of Madame Bernhardt’s impersonations,
however, fall within Mr. Winter’s proscribed
class. She has at times shown a startling
propensity for breaking into new and
strange fields. Her <i>Jeanne d’Arc</i> (1890), a
genuine success, was certainly not a “morbid
eccentric.” “It is impossible to make <i>Hamlet</i>
Parisian,” but, in 1899, Sarah played <i>Hamlet</i>,
to the satisfaction of the French at least.
“She never did anything finer,” said Rostand.
“She makes one understand Hamlet, and understand
him beyond the possibility of a doubt.”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a>
A year later she was playing Reichstadt, the
son of Napoleon, in <i>L’Aiglon</i>, an impersonation
that even Mr. Winter admitted “was one of
beautiful symmetry.” And of recent years
Sarah has threatened—though as yet she has not
accomplished—the acting of Mephistopheles in
<i>Faust</i>.</p>

<p>When Bernhardt was in London in 1895,
George Bernard Shaw was in the midst of his
career as the dramatic critic of the <i>Saturday
Review</i>, serving a three-year term of what he
called his slavery to the theatre. He observed
Sarah with none too sympathetic eyes, but what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
he said shows, under his purposefully irritating
exterior, the shrewd critical insight that makes
the “Dramatic Opinions and Essays” one of the
soundest books of theatrical comment, as well
as one of the most readable:</p>

<p>“Madame Bernhardt has the charm of a
jolly maturity, rather spoilt and petulant, perhaps,
but always ready with a sunshine-through-the-clouds
smile if only she is made much of.
Her dresses and diamonds, if not exactly splendid,
are at least splendacious; her figure, far too
scantily upholstered in the old days, is at its
best; and her complexion shows that she has not
studied modern art in vain.... She is beautiful
with the beauty of her school, and entirely
inhuman and incredible. But the incredibility
is pardonable, because, though it is all the greatest
nonsense, nobody believing in it, the actress
herself least of all, it is so artful, so clever,
so well recognized a part of the business, and
carried off with such a genial air, that it is impossible
not to accept it with good-humor. One
feels, when the heroine bursts on the scene, a
dazzling vision of beauty, that instead of imposing
on you, she adds to her own piquancy by
looking you straight in the face, and saying, in
effect: ‘Now who would ever suppose that I
am a grandmother?’ That, of course, is irresistible;
and one is not sorry to have been
coaxed to relax one’s notions of the dignity of
art when she gets to serious business and shows
how ably she does her work. The coaxing suits
well with the childishly egotistical character of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
her acting, which is not the art of making you
think more highly or feel more deeply, but the
art of making you admire her, pity her, champion
her, weep with her, laugh at her jokes, follow
her fortunes breathlessly, and applaud her
wildly when the curtain falls. It is the art of
finding out all your weaknesses and practicing
on them—cajoling you, harrowing you, exciting
you—on the whole, fooling you. And it is always
Sarah Bernhardt in her own capacity who
does this to you. The dress, the title of the
play, the order of the words may vary; but the
woman is always the same. She does not enter
into the leading character: she substitutes herself
for it.”</p>

<p>Where a more tolerant judgment would proclaim
Sarah’s inalterable romanticism, Mr.
Shaw, whose passion for truth and realism leave
him little room for the sort of truth and reality
there may be in the romantic, sees only the tricks
of her trade: “Every year Madame Bernhardt
comes to us with a new play, in which she kills
somebody with any weapon from a hairpin to a
hatchet; intones a great deal of dialogue as a
sample of what is called ‘the golden voice,’ to
the great delight of our curates, who all produce
more or less golden voices by exactly the same
trick; goes through her well-known feat of tearing
a passion to tatters at the end of the second
or fourth act, according to the length of the
piece; serves out a ration of the celebrated
smile; and between whiles gets through any ordinary
acting that may be necessary in a thoroughly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
businesslike and competent fashion.
This routine constitutes a permanent exhibition,
which is refurnished every year with fresh
scenery, fresh dialogue, and a fresh author,
whilst remaining itself invariable. Still, there
are real parts in Madame Bernhardt’s repertory
which date from the days before the traveling
show was opened; and she is far too clever a
woman, and too well endowed with stage instinct,
not to rise, in an off-handed, experimental
sort of way, to the more obvious points in such
an irresistible new part as Magda.” On the
whole, Shaw is something less than fair to
Sarah. But one cannot deny him an appreciative
chortle when he speaks of her “dragging
from sea to sea her Armada of transports.”</p>

<p>On December 9, 1896, there was held a fête
in Paris in honor of Bernhardt—the most striking
in a long line of similar occasions. It was
felt that her position as queen of the stage deserved
a public recognition. It was carried
through with Gallic enthusiasm. Sardou presided
at a mid-day banquet attended by Coppée,
Lemaître, Theuriet, Lavedan, Coquelin, Charpentier,
Rostand, and a host of others from the
literary and artistic world of Paris. Sardou
hailed her as the acknowledged sovereign of
dramatic art, and bore testimony not only to
her acting, but also to “the benevolence, the
charity, and the exquisite kindness of the
woman.” When Sarah had responded with a
few words of thanks, there was a great demonstration,
emotionally enthusiastic and Gallic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
Later in the day, at the <i>Renaissance</i>, the ceremonies
were continued. Sarah gave the third
act of <i>Phèdre</i> and the fourth act of <i>Rome Vaincue</i>.
She gave her best efforts and her hearers
were much moved. Huret records that all his
neighbors in the audience were weeping. Then,
five poets, François Coppée, Edmond Harancourt,
Catulle Mendès, André Theuriet and Edmond
Rostand, advanced in turn, each to read
a sonnet in Sarah’s honor. When Rostand’s—the
last and best—was finished, she was seen to
tremble and to stand weeping in their midst.
“No spectacle could be finer,” says Huret,
“than this woman, whose unconquerable energy
had withstood the struggles and difficulties of a
thirty-years’ career, standing overwhelmed and
vanquished by the power of a few lines of
poetry.”</p>

<p>Whether or not she was a divinely ennobled
and beneficent artist, this trait of “unconquerable
energy” is undeniably a marvel. For instance,
in January, 1906, when she was sixty-one,
she appeared in Boston. In the twenty-six
hours between half-past eight on Friday
evening and half-past ten on Saturday evening
she acted Fédora, Phèdre, and Cesarine in
Dumas’s <i>La Femme de Claude</i>, each a long,
exacting and, one would think, exhausting rôle.
At the end of the third play, however, Bernhardt
had her artistic resources and her
strength as fully under her command as at the
beginning. And she had been forty-four years
on the stage. This was but an incident of a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
widely extended tour, a sample of what she had
been doing all her life.</p>

<p>In February, 1907, she was made a professor
at the <i>Conservatoire</i>, partly in an attempt to
make her eligible for the cross of the Legion of
Honor. This was an honor that Sarah had long
desired, and, it must be said, deserved. Her
service to her country as a herald of its language
and art—to say nothing of that during 1870—has
been inestimably greater than that of many
who have received the honor. But in France an
actress is still without social position, and the
social conservatism of Paris officialdom always
prevailed in the face of Sarah’s champions.
For no actress, merely as an actress, had ever
been admitted to the Legion. In January, 1914,
however, it was announced throughout the world
that Mme. Bernhardt had received the long-coveted
decoration. The usual objections and
traditions had been interposed, but President
Poincaire himself cut the red tape. In March
the formal presentation occurred. <i>L’Université
des Annales</i> organized the ceremony. Government
officials, actors and actresses, poets,
playwrights and a throng of the notabilities
of Paris gathered to do Madame Sarah honor.
The Minister of Fine Arts, on behalf of the
Government, presented the decoration and
made a formal speech in which he summed up
her services as patriot and as a missionary of
the French language. Verses by Rostand and
other poets were read, music composed for the
occasion was played, artists advanced and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
heaped flowers at Bernhardt’s feet, and then
came forward twelve actors and actresses, each
representing a famous character in Bernhardt’s
repertoire, and speaking lines from
the original plays. The whole became a sonnet
in dialogue. Finally Bernhardt herself
ended the very French but very sincere occasion
by an eloquent and tender speech of thanks.</p>

<p>About this time a photograph found its
way into the American newspapers. It showed
Madame Sarah with the glittering cross of the
Legion pinned to her dress. Seated on her lap
and gazing at the decoration is Madame Sarah’s
<em>great-grandchild</em>.</p>

<p>We have mentioned Mr. Winter’s wholesale
repudiation of the plays in which Bernhardt attained
her eminence. Without subscribing to
the total depravity of such plays and of Bernhardt’s
influence, one can freely admit that her
appeal fell below the supremest heights of
drama, and that her field was, after all, a narrow
one. There were natural causes for this
narrowness. It was imposed by her personality.
She partakes to the fullest extent of that
variation of the French character that is predominatingly
sensual, yet regards its sensuality
as a kind of spirituality. Again, her technical
equipment as an actress included a voice
of such richness and variety of effect, and a
power of gesture and pose so naturally adapted
to the grand style, that her tendency was for
the florid and rhetorical. Thus the idealistic or
poetic play, on the one hand, and the frankly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
naturalistic on the other, were beyond her province.
The result has been, most notably, a succession
of plays by Sardou—<i>Fédora</i>, <i>Théodora</i>,
<i>La Tosca</i>, <i>Cléopâtre</i>, <i>Gismonda</i>, <i>Zoraya</i>, in
which the author “accepting her limitations,
harped time and time again upon the same
notes. His heroines are creatures all alike compounded
of Bernhardtesque attributes—feline
in their endearments, tigerish in their passions
of love and hate. As stage figures they represent
the boldest prose of the emotions, expressed
with a rhetoric that is flawless, but still
rhetoric.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<p>So much for the main note. In a career so
astonishingly long and successful there have
been, of course, others. We have seen how, in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
<i>L’Aiglon</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, and <i>Jeanne d’Arc</i> she boldly
went outside her usual field. Even within it
there have been of course many moments of
winning appeal or great power. To none other
than Mr. Winter did her Frou-Frou appear
pure-spirited, “an exquisite texture ... of
childlike womanhood,”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> and as Floria Tosca
“Bernhardt’s acting ... was magnificent,—for
it created the effect of perfect illusion”;
it will “be remembered with a shuddering
sense of horror as long as anything is remembered
of her achievement.... Of its kind
it was absolutely perfect art.” In <i>La Femme
X</i> he found her art consummate. Her Marguérite
Gauthier in <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i> did
much to give that heroine genuine and compelling
appeal to the purer emotions, her Phèdre
has its moments of genuine nobility. And
though it may be true that, in the main, she
worked in those strata of the drama that are of
“little benefit to humanity,” the sheer extent
and strength of her influence bear witness that
much in her work found a response in the minds
and sympathies of two generations of people.</p>

<p>She is, after all, unique, whatever the loftiness
of her message; for the intensity of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
power, the span of time over which she has exercised
it and the universality of her fame combine
to write a chapter that stands alone in
theatrical annals.</p>

<div class="tb">* <span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">* </span><span class="in2">*</span></div>

<p>To the body of Bernhardtian legend has now
been added the legend of the leg. This time it
is an authentic legend, and one that adds
greatly to Sarah’s merited fame for courage
and will.</p>

<p>In February, 1915, she wrote to Mme. Jane
Catulle Mendès:</p>

<p>“<i>My Dear</i>: As you perhaps have learned,
they are going to cut off my leg Monday. They
should have done so last Sunday, but it seems I
was not sufficiently prepared for that first performance.
The principal artist, my right leg,
had not learned its rôle. It has now learned it,
and it will be charming.”</p>

<p>There is a long story of patiently endured
suffering back of that lightly phrased note.
In 1912 she made a visit to America, playing—as
before and since in London—in the vaudeville
theatres short scenes from her former successes.
There were circumstances in her acting
that puzzled the beholders. She would take a
fixed position and maintain it for long periods.
When she moved across the stage, it was usually
with another’s support. Such hamperings to
her acting were commonly put down to her
advanced age, or sometimes to rheumatism.
As a matter of fact, Sarah had for ten years<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
suffered from osteoarthritis—chronic inflammation
of the articulation of her right knee. The
trouble manifested itself first at Montevideo,
and was there temporarily and inadequately
treated. From that time, at first intermittently
and then continuously, the knee brought her
pain that she endured with fortitude and without
curtailment of her work. As time went on,
she gradually modified the business of her parts,
and even had plays written to suit her limitations,—as
in <i>Le Procès de Jeanne d’Arc</i>, in
which she stood in court all during one act and
in another remained seated at the side of her
bed.</p>

<p>In the Spring of 1914, while she was playing
in Liège, she gave the afflicted knee a slight
sprain. Upon this, the trouble became acute.
She remained, first at her house on Belle Isle,
and later at Andernos, now Arcachon, with the
knee in a fixed plaster cast. The pain was reduced;
Mme. Sarah could paint and could work
on her memoirs, and her general health was excellent;
but here she was with her career cut
off! When the surgeons, hoping to replace the
cast with some apparatus that would permit
her to walk, found that instead the knee would
have to be kept unmoved for an indefinite time,
Sarah took matters into her own hands, and ordered
the offending member removed. It was
better, she said, in a letter to Maurice Barres,
“to be mutilated than to remain impotent.”</p>

<p>On February 22, 1915, at Bordeaux, in her
seventy-first year, Mme. Bernhardt’s right leg<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
was amputated above the knee. “While the
hospital attendants were preparing for the operation,”
said a dispatch from her bedside,
“the actress conversed volubly with her doctors:
‘Work is my life. So soon as I can be
fitted with an artificial leg, I shall resume the
stage and all my good spirits shall be restored.
I hope again to be able to use all that force of
art which now upholds me and which will sustain
me until beyond the grave,’”—a speech, as
Philip Hale said, “worthy of one of Plutarch’s
men.” Surgeons and nurses present at the operation
were deeply impressed by the calm courage
with which she faced the operation.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<p>Even in the midst of the horrors and anxieties
of universal war, Bernhardt’s ordeal challenged
world-wide sympathy. Portraits and
eulogies appeared in every paper. For a week
or more, until it became certain that the operation
had been successful, bulletins on her condition
were printed daily. Queen Victoria of
Spain, the aged Eugénie, M. Deschanel, president
of the Chamber of Deputies, Edmond
Rostand—these were only a few of those, both
proud and humble, whose messages poured in
upon her from all quarters. Alexandra, Queen-mother
of Great Britain, sent word of the
“sympathy which all England shares for the
greatest artist in the world.” After the operation,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
Mme. Bernhardt said that she was to “live
again. Already I am free from suffering,
happy and full of courage, and now I am going
to get well quickly. I shall retake my place in
the world.”</p>

<p>This announcement was sufficiently astounding.
The remarkable woman then followed it
with another,—that she would make a new tour
in America, this time not in the vaudeville
theatres (where interest in her was before not
overwhelming), but in the regular theatres,
where she would offer a number of plays in
which she has not yet been seen on this side of
the Atlantic.</p>

<p>Thus does Bernhardt remain vividly alive to
the last. M. Jules Lemaître once said that he
admired her because of the unknown he felt
to be in her. “She might go into a nunnery,
discover the North Pole, be inoculated with
rabies, assassinate an emperor, or marry a
negro king, and I should never be surprised at
anything she did. She is more alive and more
incomprehensible by herself than a thousand
other human beings.”</p>

<p>Thus it may be that she will again rally about
her on the stage of Paris the loyal affection that
went out to her in the hospital. It is an open
secret that for half a dozen years the allegiance
of her Paris public has not always been unflagging.
She is indubitably old, and her affliction
was imperfectly understood. And yet,
when her latest play, <i>Jeanne Doré</i>, by Tristan
Bernard, was produced in December, 1913, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
flash of the old enthusiasm broke out again and
one correspondent described the occasion as
“easily the most brilliant first night of the
Paris season so far.” The part, moreover,
was an exacting emotional one. In it Madame
Sarah seems again to have shown her great
power.</p>

<h2 id="HELENA_MODJESKA">HELENA MODJESKA</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The</span> acting of Madame Modjeska is still
remembered vividly by American and
English theatregoers, yet its beginnings lie as
far away in time as the sixties and as distant
in place as Poland. She was born on October
12, 1840, in Cracow, the old Polish capital, now
the second city of Galitzia, or Austrian Poland.
Twenty-five years before, by the agreement of
Russia, Prussia, and Austria, it had been proclaimed
a free city. In the year when Modjeska
was six, however, Austria, greedy then as
now, broke her pledge and annexed the city.
The Poles were always a passionately patriotic
people, and did not submit calmly. Discontent
grew to open revolt, but the hopes of the Cracovians
were crushed by the bombardment of
the city by the Austrians in 1848.</p>

  <div class="caption">HELENA MODJESKA</div></div>

<p>Thus the little Helcia<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> was born in tragic
times, and as a little girl saw scenes of terror
and bloodshed. Her mother’s house was struck
by the cannon shot, and she saw men and children
killed before her very door. The horrors
of those days were vividly impressed upon her
memory and were perhaps not without their
effect upon the nature of the future actress.</p>

<p>Her father, Michael Opid, born in the Carpathian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
mountains, and a teacher in the high
school in Cracow, was a simple-hearted, lovable
man, something of a scholar and a great lover
of music. He was extremely fond of children.
His own girls and boys and those of his neighbors
would gather about him in the evening,
listening to the folk lore of the mountaineers,
Polish legends, and tales from the Iliad.
When Helcia, years later, herself studied
Homer, those winter evenings and their stories
were vividly recalled. But Michael Opid’s
chief delight was music. He played several
instruments, the flute especially well. His
melodies appealed almost too strongly to the
sensitive little Helcia, who during plaintive
passages in the music would burst into wails
and cries. Singers and musicians were frequent
visitors at the Opid house, and in its
atmosphere there was thus an artistic element,
which undoubtedly had some influence in determining
the career of Helcia. Her father
died when she was seven, of consumption, induced
by exposure while seeking his drowned
brother’s body. When he knew he was dangerously
ill, he returned to his native mountains to die.</p>

<p>It had been the second marriage of Madame
Opid. She had been Madame Benda, and having
altogether ten children to care for, she
could give by no means exclusive attention to
any one of them, even had she known that that
one was to be a great actress. The children
were well cared for so far as their bodily wants<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
were concerned, but their personalities were
left to themselves to develop. For Helcia this
was not altogether unfortunate, for her imagination,
stirred by history-making events
and by the songs and poems of which she was
so fond, had free rein. She did not care much
for the society of other children, and was not
popular with them. She was a little dreamer,
almost painfully bashful, living much in a
world of her imagination, and fond of going to
church. She would steal away alone to the
Dominican chapel, where she would lie face
down on the floor, in the manner of the peasant
women, arms outstretched, kissing the floor and
praying for a miracle or a glimpse of an angel
or a saint.</p>

<p>Her first schooling was in the house of a
friend of her mother’s, a woman with two well-educated
daughters who taught the little Helcia,
by the time she was seven, to read with ease.
She fed her imagination with all the books she
could find at hand. In school she liked her
Polish history, her French and her grammar.</p>

<p>When Helcia was seven, she was taken to the
theatre for the first time. The play was <i>The
Daughter of the Regiment</i>, and was followed by
a ballet <i>The Siren of Dniestr</i>, in which little
Josephine Hofmann (to be Josef Hofmann’s
aunt) dressed as a butterfly, hovered about in
the air. Helcia was entranced; to her it was all
a dream of joy come true.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> She went to bed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
that night with a high fever, and for weeks
afterward she practiced the butterfly dance,
watching her shadow on the wall, much to the
amusement of her small brothers. But theatricals
became the family pastime. Helcia’s
three older brothers were enthusiastic. They
rigged up a stage at home, with the help of some
other boys formed a little company, and every
month gave performances for admiring friends.
They excluded the girls, and played all the
women’s parts themselves. The home theatre
was probably of great influence in the lives of
its members, for two of the boys, besides Helcia
and her sister, subsequently went on the stage.</p>

<p>In 1850, when Helcia was in her tenth year,
Cracow was burned. The conflagration lasted
ten days, and a large part of the city was destroyed.
Madame Opid up to this time had
been a woman of some property. Her first
husband had left her a small estate which she
had managed skillfully. Her two houses were
now destroyed, her insurance had lapsed ten
days before, and she was practically ruined.
Here was more misfortune to impress the growing
Helcia, to make her, for her years, unusually
sensitive and thoughtful. After a few days of
almost vagabondage, the family was given
temporary quarters in a friend’s house. There
Helcia, left much to herself, spent her time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
reading her <i>Life of St. Genevieve</i>, a treasured
volume which she rescued in the moment of
peril. At length installed in a newly hired
house, Madame Opid sent Helcia and her little
sister Josephine as day pupils to St. John’s
convent, and supplemented the teachings of the
sisters with lessons at home in music and dancing.</p>

<p>It was at this time, when Helena was ten,
that she first met Gustave Modrzejewski,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> who
was later to be her husband. He was twenty
years her senior. He was a friend of the family
and taught the children German, the hated
language of the oppressor.</p>

<p>When Helena was twelve, her half-brothers
Joseph and Felix Benda had gone away to be
actors on the professional stage. To relieve
the quiet at home she and her brother Adolphe
Opid, who was then fifteen, wrote a play, a one-act
tragedy. The scene was laid in Greece, and
the acting required the death of Adolphe, and an
impassioned scene of grief by Helena when
with a sob she threw herself over her dead
lover’s body. She drew from the sympathetic
servants and her great-aunt Theresa genuine
tears, but her practical mother was unmoved,
thought Helena over-excited and forbade further
theatricals.</p>

<p>At fourteen Helena finished the highest grade
at the convent. This was the end of her formal
schooling, but she at once began a strenuous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
and varied course of reading. She began
with the Polish poets, of whom there are several
proudly cherished by their countrymen.
It was the family’s pleasant custom, fostered
by the well-read Mr. Modrzejewski, to read
aloud in the winter evenings. In this way
Helena learned of Scott, Dickens, Dumas,
George Sand, and many another. She had
neglected her German, and it was to stimulate
an interest in the disliked language that Mr.
Modrzejewski proposed that she be taken to
see a German play. She was immensely excited,
for it was seven years since she had been
to the theatre. The play was Schiller’s
<i>Kabale und Liebe</i>. She entered the theatre in
a state of awe, she sat through the performance
in spellbound fascination, and the next morning
with the help of a dictionary began reading
Schiller in German. Schiller became for the
time an overwhelming enthusiasm with her.
She imagined herself in love with him, and
placed before her in her room his statuette, as
a kind of idol. Such extravagances as this, and
the religious period that preceded it, would
have indicated to a discerning eye a promisingly
responsive and emotional nature. To
those about her, however, even to her mother,
she was only a moody and at times excitable
child whose enthusiasm was to be repressed
and whose future was doubtful. She helped
with the family work, as all did in this time
of stress, but she was living apart in a world of
poetry, of vague and ardent dreams.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
She was now taken to the theatre occasionally.
Felix Benda had become one of the popular
actors of the local theatre. One day,
when Helena was about sixteen, he overheard
her reciting to her sister. Surprised and
pleased, he took her next day to the house of
one of the leading actresses of the company,
who as an artist of experience could judge of
the young girl’s chances of success on the stage.
All this came very suddenly. Helena had not
seriously thought of a stage career. The hearing
was a trying ordeal, for she was terribly
frightened. After giving Helena a lesson or
two, the actress was discouraging. She advised
Madame Opid to keep the young girl at
home rather than allow her to become a mediocre
actress. For a while Helcia’s budding ambitions
were crushed.</p>

<p>Madame Opid, for one, was not disappointed.
The family was not so well off as it was before
the fire and to Helcia fell a large share of the
housework. But she studied and read and
thought, with unsettled mind and changing purpose.
At one time she thought she would try
to achieve fame as a writer; again, at her
mother’s wish, she studied furiously with a
teacher’s examination in mind; again, to become
a nun seemed the only thing worth while.
But shortly there came a rude shock to all these
plans. Fritz Devrient, a German actor of
great talent, played <i>Hamlet</i> in Cracow, and
Helena was taken to see him. She had heard of
Shakespeare, but had never seen or read any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of his plays. The effect on her was overwhelming.
Shakespeare became her master then and
there, and she never deserted him. She spent
a sleepless night, and the longing to be an actress
returned with redoubled strength. She
greedily read the plays of Shakespeare in Polish
translations, and his bust speedily replaced
that of Schiller. The family friend, Gustave
Modrzejewski, to her great delight seconded
her in her renewed ambition, recommended that
she study for the German stage as offering a
wider field than the Polish, and arranged for
lessons from an excellent actor, Herr Axtman.
Indeed, his interest extended further, for when
Helcia was seventeen he urged that their marriage,
which had come to be an understood
thing, take place at once. She had seen much
of him; they had read together Goethe and Lessing
and the northern sagas; he was her guardian
and the kindly counselor of the family; and
she looked on him, a man more than twice her
age, with real affection; and so they were married
at once.</p>

<p>After Helena had taken the name which she
was to make so famous, there followed a few
quiet years during which her ambitions lay in
abeyance. When she was twenty her son Rudolphe
was born. The little family, and Madame
Opid as well, moved to Bochnia, a little
town in Austrian Poland. Here it was that,
owing to the circumstance that Bochnia possessed
salt mines, Mme. Modjeska had her first
opportunity to appear on a real stage. Some<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
of the miners had been killed in an accident. It
occurred to the Modjeskis to give, for the benefit
of the bereaved families, some amateur theatricals.
They met a friend, a dancing master
named Loboiko, who obtained a hall, hastily
built some scenery and acted as leading man
of the company. There were but three others—a
young man who was the dancing master’s
pupil, Helena as leading lady, and Josephine,
her younger sister. Stasia, their nine-year-old
niece, was prompter. The plays were two
pieces now forgotten—<i>The White Camelia</i>,
in one act, in which Helena was a countess, and
<i>The Prima-Donna</i>, in which she was an Italian
peasant girl who became an actress. Delighted
as she was to realize her cherished
ambition to appear on the stage before an actual
audience, when the bell rang for the rise of the
curtain she was thoroughly frightened. Before
she went on she could not think of her lines, and
she fairly shook with nervousness. Yet once
on the stage her words came to her and she
found herself, much to her surprise, quite at
her ease. The dignitaries and the country gentlemen
of the district and the townspeople all
turned out for the performance, and for the two
others that followed it, in unexpectedly large
numbers. Madame Modjeska’s acting, at this
her first opportunity for showing it, attracted
attention. An actor and stage manager from
Warsaw, who happened to be in Bochnia and
saw her act, asked her how long she had been
on the stage,—an amusing and pleasing question,—and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
urged her to turn her eyes toward
Warsaw. Such men do not pay empty compliments,
and Helena’s confidence now took new
hold. The prospect of going to Warsaw drove
from her mind any idea of becoming a German
actress. It was Warsaw and the Imperial Theatre,
or die!</p>

<p>Such was the modest beginning of a career.
Mr. Modjeski, so far from objecting to his
young wife’s being an actress, saw in the new
turn of affairs a chance to retrieve the family
fortunes and to get a living for them all. A
license for a traveling company was obtained
from Cracow, Mr. Modjeski constituted himself
manager, and the little band of players, travelling
in a peasant’s wagon, went on to New Sandec.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
Here the company was gradually enlarged
until it had nineteen members, and here
they stayed all summer. Helena was from the
beginning their star. She and her comrades
were but strolling players, living in poorly furnished
quarters and eating frugal meals. She
had but two dresses, one black for tragedy, the
other white for comedy. Yet she was happy as
never before or perhaps since. Long afterward
she thrilled with the recollection of the
enthusiasm and joy of those early days. To
live in her own world of youth and eager beginnings<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
and at the same time in the imaginary
world of her heroines, was a happiness that outweighed
all lack of comforts.</p>

<p>For more than a year the company traveled
about in Austrian Poland. It was during this
period that the Polish insurrection of 1863 was
brewing. The oppression under which Russian
Poland suffered found sympathy in Galitzia
and indeed the entire Polish people was in
mourning. Every one, at least in the towns,
wore black, for the wearing of colors was practically
forbidden by public feeling. Yet people
contrived to go to the theatre, and “The New
Sandec Combination,” as it was called, prospered.
Their Polish historical pieces roused
the patriotism of their audiences and did their
share in maintaining the spirit of the people
in the face of the Russian outrages.</p>

<p>Madame Modjeska was the favorite of the
provincial public to which her company addressed
itself. The popular demand for her
was such that the audiences fell off when she
was not in the cast, and she consequently was
forced to appear constantly. When her daughter
was born<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> she had finished acting her part
in a five act tragedy only two hours before; and
in ten days she was again appearing. The company
grew in size and improved in quality, and
their repertoire was enlarged to include such
plays as Schiller’s <i>Die Räuber</i> and <i>Sheridan’s
The School for Scandal</i>.</p>

<p>This year and a half of “barnstorming” was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
invaluable experience for Modjeska. It gave
her confidence and technique, and, finally, recognition.
One of the managers of the endowed
theatre of Lemberg<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> had seen and liked her acting.
In the autumn of 1862 the Modjeskis retired
from the strolling company, and after a
few probationary performances Helena, then
twenty-two, was enrolled a member of the resident
company at Lemberg. With her first opportunity
to play on a well-equipped stage, with
good actors, and before a city audience, she felt
that she had made a distinct step upward. She
played a wide variety of characters, ranging
from great ladies to pages, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ingénues</i>, and the
soubrette parts in operetta. She profited by
the example and the friendly advice of Madame
Ashberger, who was the leading lady, but the
younger women of the company were jealous of
the upstart newcomer with the pretty face.
They influenced the management to give Modjeska
only small parts, and this, with the insufficiency
of the salary, so discouraged her that
after a year at Lemberg she and her husband
returned to try their fortunes again in the
provinces.</p>

<p>Mr. Modjeski established in the town of Czerniowce
a stock company that was largely a
family affair. Joseph and Felix Benda, Helena’s
half-brothers, her sister’s husband and
Josephine herself, all were members, while
Simon Benda led the orchestra. There were
more than twenty actors altogether, some of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
whom afterwards became famous in Poland.
The two years at Czerniowce Modjeska filled
with hard work. 1863 marked the crisis in the
affairs of unhappy Poland. The Galitzians
were only less stirred by the tyranny and bloodshed
in Russian Poland than their kinsfolk,
the victims. Excitement and patriotic feeling
ran high and troops were being raised everywhere;
yet throughout this troublous period the
theatres prospered. As for Modjeska, with
admirable energy and ambition she studied and
worked. So far she had not played in tragedy.
On a visit to Vienna, a brief vacation she took
to see a bit of the world with Mr. Modjeski, a
manager before whom she tried her powers in a
scene from <i>Marie Stuart</i> advised her to cultivate
her voice and her German before essaying
the more serious rôles. Accordingly she
practiced faithfully in the midst of a busy
career at the theatre. She had attained a considerable
reputation in Galitzia, and, as before,
appeared constantly, not only in the company’s
home town but in towns about the province.
She was happy in her work, but her health was
suffering, and for a while consumption threatened
her. Other troubles soon came. In 1865
her two year old daughter died, and soon afterwards
other misfortunes, of a domestic nature,
ended in her separation from her husband,
whom she never saw again.</p>

<p>Moving now to her birthplace, Cracow, with
her mother, her little son and her brother Felix,
she was soon a member of the company at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
old theatre where she had been taken, years before,
to see the plays that had so greatly excited
her.</p>

<p>Modjeska began her three years at Cracow
when she was almost twenty-five. She had attained
genuine popularity in her own province
and her reputation was beginning, among those
particularly interested in the drama, to extend
to other parts of Poland. As the able stage
director at Cracow, Mr. Jasinski, told her, she
had been petted by the public and spoiled by the
critics.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> The Cracow theatre was beginning a
new era just at this time and with the importation
into its management of a group of enthusiastic
and artistically well-equipped men it set
for itself a standard equal to that of the national
theatre at Warsaw. It was natural therefore
that her term of service here taught Modjeska
much. First she learned from Mr. Jasinski for
the first time the proper delivery of blank verse.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
At his earnest solicitation, and under the sting
of remarks by a jealous fellow actress, who advised
her to leave serious parts alone, she resolutely
undertook tragic characters for the first
time. Her parts were sometimes small, sometimes
important.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> After her performance in
<i>Don Carlos</i>, which came a few months after
she joined the company and for which she prepared
herself (since Mr. Jasinski had returned
to Warsaw), she felt that she had to a degree
realized her ambition. She had succeeded in a
serious part, and was a recognized member of
an important company. She was absorbed and
happy in her work and thought of little else.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
The political troubles of Poland, if not settled,
were at least stifled. There was outward calm
to match the content with which Modjeska labored
during these important years. Those
who consider success on the stage easily
achieved have only to look at such a period as
this in the life of a great actress. She frequently
arose at five in the morning and studied
and rehearsed all day. She and her brother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
Felix would go over scenes at all hours and in
all places. She carefully worked out the last
detail of costuming, of pose or intonation, developing
her impersonations to her utmost.
And when the time for performance came, she
threw herself into her work body and soul.
There has always been much discussion as to
whether or not an actor, for the best effect,
should “feel his part.” Modjeska was always
one of those who did. “I really passed through
all the emotions of my heroines,” she afterwards
wrote. “I suffered with them, cried real
tears, which I often could not stop even after
the curtain was down. Owing to this extreme
sensitiveness I was exhausted after each emotional
part, and often had to rest motionless
after the play until my strength returned. I
tried hard to master my emotions, but during
my whole career I could not succeed in giving
a performance without feeling the agonies of
my heroines.”</p>

<p>It was during a visit of the Cracow Company
to Posen, the capital of Prussian Poland, that
Madame Modjeska met Count Karol Bozenta
Chlapowski, who was soon to be her second husband.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a>
He came of a noble Polish family and
had served in the revolt of 1863. At the time
he met Modjeska (1866) he was a writer on politics
and the drama for one of the newspapers
of Posen. In this capacity he commented
frankly on the shortcomings he found in Modjeska’s
acting, but his candor did not prevent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
their becoming good friends. He coached her
in French, and they read and talked much together.
It was here, when romance was coming
into her own life, that she read for the first time
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. It carried her to the highest
pitch of enthusiasm for Shakespeare. At her
earnest wish, it was played successfully with
Modjeska as Juliet, while the company was in
Posen.</p>

<p>Before she returned to Cracow to act, Modjeska
was granted leave of six weeks, with the
suggestion that she go to Paris and study the
best French actors. Paris charmed her, while
her visits to the theatres—and every evening
found her in one or another—were inspiring to
the sensitive young woman on the threshold of
her own career. The restraint of the French
actors’ methods, their admirable grace and precision,
their imaginative identification with
their characters, and the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ensemble</i> which is the
mark of the French stage at its best, were noted
for her own good by the rising Polish star.</p>

<p>She was given an ovation when she reappeared
at Cracow. <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was
repeated and, to her delight (for Shakespeare
was her constant enthusiasm), she had an opportunity
to appear as Lady Anne in <i>Richard
the Third</i>, as Titania in <i>A Midsummer Night’s
Dream</i>, and as Desdemona in <i>Othello</i>. Many
plays from the French and German were
also given, but the basis of the Cracow theatre’s
repertoire was naturally Polish.</p>

<p>This was to Modjeska a happy and successful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
period. As was her custom, she threw herself
into her work with all her energy, and besides
her parts studied hard her French, her music,
and even an elaborate course in history. Indeed
she worked so during this year (1866–7)
that one day, during a rehearsal of <i>Kabale und
Liebe</i> she suddenly lost her memory; she could
not think of a word of her part. In two weeks,
however, she had recovered and was at work
again.</p>

<p>In 1868 she married Count Chlapowski
and thereby became a member of the aristocracy.
She was not the first actress to marry
into the Polish nobility, but in her case, as in
none before, the husband’s family and society
in general welcomed her with open arms. And
indeed, in receiving into their number a woman
of her personal worth and attainments, they
were accepting rather than bestowing honor.</p>

<p>Now came the moment that Modjeska herself
always believed to be the turning point in her
career. Seven years before, when she and
three other amateurs were giving their little
plays for charity in Bochnia, she had been seen,
it will be remembered, by one of the staff of
managers of the Warsaw Imperial Theatre.
He had told her that one day he hoped to see
her in Warsaw. Now, in 1868, her reputation
as one of the leading actresses of the Cracow
theatre brought about the fulfillment of his
hope, for she was invited to Warsaw to give a
special series of performances. As for her, this
was the realization of a dream. She did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
then even think of the career she was to have
in foreign lands in a language other than Polish.
She was intensely patriotic, and the utmost
reasonable limit of her ambition was to
act in the Imperial Theatre at Warsaw. It was
one of the great state theatres of Europe, controlled
and subsidized by the Russian Government,
and, with its various companies for serious
drama, comedy, opera, and comic opera, its
ballet, choruses, orchestras, schools, officials and
employees, enrolled something over seven hundred
people. It was extraordinary for an actress
who had not gone through the school and
waited her chance of gradual promotion to appear
on its stage; and the innovation aroused
the keenest hostility among the members of the
company. The husband of one of the actresses
was an editor, and before Modjeska appeared,
attacked her in print. When the newcomer rehearsed
for the first time attempts were begun
to discredit her. The rehearsal of her part in
<i>Les Idées de Madame Aubray</i> went so well
that she was jubilant until it was suddenly announced
that owing to the sickness of one of the
actors (who up to now was apparently in perfect
health) the play would have to be changed.
In the rehearsal Modjeska had shown such ability
that the clique arrayed against her knew
their point would be lost unless some play were
put on that would test her powers more severely.
So <i>Adrienne Lecouvreur</i> was suggested,
a play in which Rachel had been the only
one thoroughly to succeed. Modjeska saw the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
danger, but agreed to play Adrienne. At rehearsal
she little more than “walked through”
her part, taking care not to reveal her best
powers, lest the unpleasant incident be repeated.
The cabal succeeded, however, in playing
her another trick: at the last moment another
actress, the wife of the hostile editor, was
given Modjeska’s part of Adrienne for the first
performance of the play’s revival. This was
intended to decrease the interest in Modjeska’s
first appearance; yet when her night arrived
the great house was filled. The controversy
over her invitation to Warsaw, and the unusual
spectacle of a nobleman’s actress-wife continuing
to act after her marriage, combined to
arouse the keenest interest.</p>

<p>The audience received her cordially, and listened
attentively. At the close of the fable of
the two pigeons, a passage which she delivered
with much charm and tenderness, there was such
applause as she had never heard before. After
each act she was called out again and again, and
at the end of the play received an unprecedented
ovation. Even those members of the company
who had tried to prevent her appearance were
won over by her power, her grace, and her immediate
success, and appeared in her dressing-room
to congratulate her. Next day all the
papers praised her, and during the next week
the cards and invitations that formed the tribute
of Warsaw society poured in upon her.</p>

<p>Within a few days Modjeska had signed a
contract to play at the Imperial Warsaw Theatre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
the rest of her life, the term of her service
to begin in the autumn of 1869, for she had still
(in 1868) to complete her season in Cracow.
In view of the conditions under which American
and English actors, even those of the first rank,
are to-day obliged to work, it is interesting to
note the terms of Modjeska’s contract at Warsaw.
She was to have twenty-five thousand
florins<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> a year, four months holiday in each
year, eight hundred roubles<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> yearly for gowns,
and an annual benefit performance. She was
to be permitted to act each year in six new plays
of her own choice (a great concession on the
part of a conservative management) and was
to be expected to appear only three times a
week! When she departed for Cracow, the
people of Warsaw crowded to the station,
throwing flowers into her carriage, and shouting
their farewells. The visit to Warsaw had
indeed been a triumph.</p>

<p>Count Chlapowski’s interest in a new political
party and his editorship of its daily paper in
Cracow brought about him and his wife, who
after the end of the season in the spring of 1869
laid aside for the moment her theatrical work, a
political and literary <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>. Poets, patriots,
scientific men, artists, all were found at the
house of the charming actress and the nobleman-editor<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a>.
During her three seasons at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
Cracow she had played one hundred and thirteen
parts—an impressive achievement in itself.
Modjeska was now expected to act in Warsaw
for the rest of her life. Instead, she remained
less than seven years.</p>

<p>Her departure was brought about by several
causes. It was not long before she became
the moving spirit of the whole vast
organization. As the extension of the repertoire
was largely in her hands, it was to her
that translators and authors had to apply. She
therefore had considerable responsibility,
which she appreciated, concerning the development
of the Polish drama. The management
found itself deferring to her in all kinds of matters.
Moreover, her husband, forced to a
choice between his own career and hers, had
given up his Cracow interests, and together in
Warsaw they soon found themselves the center
of social interest. Their <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i> became an established
and brilliant affair. Her domination
of an artistic and social world to which she was
a newcomer naturally aroused envy, and resulting
attempts to make her uncomfortable had
their part in wearying her of Warsaw. Then,
in her ambition to enlarge and enrich the theatre’s
repertoire, she had constantly to combat
the autocracy and unintelligence of the Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
censorship. When she wished to produce
<i>Hamlet</i> the censor objected to a play in
which a King was murdered, as a possible suggestion
of disloyal ideas, and it was only when
he was shown that the murder was a family
affair, not a public assassination, that he reluctantly
relented. To another play he objected
on the ground that it contained a Polish king, to
a Russian an unthinkable person. The king
had to be changed to a prince. Covert allusions
to the wrongs of Poland were suspected where
none existed and even certain words were taboo.
A love passage might be suspected to be
an apostrophe to the oppressed mother country;
the word “slave” was considered objectionable,
and “negro” substituted; if a character said:
“I love my country and my people,” his affections
were transferred by official order to his
wife and children, and, in one play the words:
“He walked arm in arm with the emperor and
whispered in his ear,” were changed to “He
walked three steps behind the emperor and
whispered in his ear”! Such obstructions to
Modjeska’s plans, though often amusing, were
oftener maddening.</p>

<p>In 1875 Madame Mouchanoff, the wife of the
president of the Warsaw theatre, died. A woman
of great refinement, intellect, and force, she
had befriended and inspired Modjeska, and the
loss of her was severe. In the same year Felix
Benda died, another blow, for her half-brother
had been a good friend and wise counselor. In
the meantime Modjeska had herself had a severe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
illness. Now, in the spring of 1876, the
nervousness induced by her strenuous career
on the stage and in society combined with
sorrow over the attacks on her and irritation
with the censor to induce a melancholy, a pessimism,
that brought her to a dangerous state
of discouragement and ill-health.</p>

<p>One night the Chlapowskis and their guests
were discussing America and the coming Centennial
Exposition at Philadelphia. At first in
jest, a general emigration to America was suggested.
They would have there an ideal community,
a care-free natural life far removed
from Russian oppression, and Pani Helena<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
could have her much needed rest. The idea
took root. The would-be emigrants were
thought foolish by most of their friends, but
Henryk Sienkiewicz (afterwards the famous
author of <i>Quo Vadis?</i>), Count Chlapowski
himself, his friends Jules Sypniewski and Lucian
Paprocki, were all soon in deadly earnest.
California they had heard of as an earthly paradise,
where life was idyllic and the earth yielded
up not only an easily won living, but fortune.</p>

<p>The suddenly achieved result was that Sienkiewicz
sailed for America in a few months, and
the others arranged to follow. Modjeska obtained
leave of absence from the president of
the theatre, who cheerfully expected her to come
back, but fixed a forfeit of six thousand roubles
if she did not. In June, 1876, she appeared
in Warsaw for the last time. There was a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
great popular demonstration. The house was
crowded and to the highest degree enthusiastic.
After the performance the audience formed a
double rank to the gates of the theatre grounds
and shouted their farewells and praises. The
public, at least, was with her to the last.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>In July, 1876, she sailed from Bremen for
New York, with Count Chlapowski, her son Rudolphe,
Jules Sypniewski, his wife and two children,
and Lucian Paprocki,—a strange band of
pilgrims, artists with little but their ideals and
comradeship to fit them for pioneering in a
strange country, headed by a woman who was
giving up a career of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande dame</i> and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">première
artiste</i> for the prospect of life on a farm
eight thousand miles or so from the scene of
her triumphs!</p>

<p>Modjeska had never seen the ocean, and the
voyage of thirteen days was invigorating. Her
party spent about a month in New York, making
excursions to Philadelphia to see the exposition,
where she admired the vegetables and fruits
from California, experimented with those
dainties new to her, pop-corn and peanuts, and
found them tasteless, and visited the art exhibits.
New York of 1876 she thought a “monstrous,
untidy bazaar.” In August they
started for California, taking ship for Panama.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
She found charming her first glimpse of the
tropics, during the railroad trip across the Isthmus,
and the three weeks’ voyage on the Pacific
went far to restore her vigor and peace of mind.</p>

<p>The impression has been that Modjeska returned
to the stage because of the failure of the
farming experiment which was now to be made.
To a certain extent this is true, but even before
she reached California she certainly had vague
plans to act again. In a letter from New
York she had said: “It seems that I may be
able to play in English, but first we must go to
California, according to our original plan....
Perhaps after we get established in this
new paradise I may pick up enough English to
play there, and when I get more mastery over
the new language, I may come here; for, however
unattractive New York seems to me, it is
the metropolis of America, and it will give me
pleasure to conquer it.” This was surely forecasting
the future. When she reached San
Francisco, Edwin Booth was playing there. It
was proposed that she act Ophelia in Polish, to
his <i>Hamlet</i>. Rather to her relief, Booth, who
had never heard of her, declined. She saw him
as Antony and as Shylock and of course recognized
him as the great actor that he was, though
as yet she could not understand English.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
As for the community farming experiment at
Anaheim, it was a failure that would appear
ludicrous if it were not for its element of tragedy.
All of the experimenters were desperately
homesick, and none of them had the least
practical notion of the task they had set themselves.
They talked more than they worked,
quarreled and made up, and were generally
helpless. Modjeska, the queen of the Warsaw
stage, did the cooking, with the frightened assistance
of a Polish maid they had taken from
a convent to be a helper with the children.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
They had several cows, but no one knew how to
milk them, and their butter and milk they had
to buy. The orange trees were too young to
bear, the season was dry, the neighbors’ cattle
ate the barley, the dogs ate the eggs, and the
ready money was fast disappearing. The unfortunate
town-bred would-be farmers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
doomed to failure from the start. So Modjeska
determined upon the courageous and difficult
course which brought in time so great an addition
to her fame. She decided to go to San
Francisco, learn English, and go upon the
American stage.</p>

<p>In March, 1877, she wrote from San Francisco
to a friend in Poland: “I am hard at work,
studying. That was my secret plan, at the very
beginning of our venture. Country life was
simply to restore my health and strength, which
it did so effectively that people give me twenty-four
or twenty-six years of age, not more....
Next autumn I want to ask the president<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
which he prefers, either six thousand roubles
for breaking my contract, or my return in two
years with fame.”</p>

<p>She could not have returned to Warsaw, indeed,
had she wished to do so, for she was now
poor. She even sold some of her family silver
to maintain herself and her son in San Francisco
while Mr. Chlapowski<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> was winding up
the affairs of the farm. With a young Polish-American
woman as tutor, she labored incessantly
with English, and to such good effect that
in about six months, having gotten Adrienne
and Juliet letter-perfect, she applied for an engagement
at the California Theatre. John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
McCullough was the star and manager, but he
was absent. His representative, Barton Hill,
knew nothing of Madame Modjeska and told
her there was no opportunity to engage her as
a star. Her friend the tutor persisted, and obtained
an appointment for a hearing, but when
Modjeska presented herself at the theatre he
found himself unable to keep the engagement.
She was deeply discouraged. A star of the first
magnitude at home, here she had to beg for a
hearing, and then be refused. When she again
applied at the theatre and Mr. Hill sent word
that he was too busy to see her, she was genuinely
humiliated. Some Polish friends interceded,
however, and a rehearsal was arranged.
Mr. Hill at last heard her, in an act of <i>Adrienne
Lecouvreur</i>. He was unprepared for
what he was to experience, for so far as he knew
she was merely another “society woman” with
a craze for the stage. She was stung to her
best efforts, and at the end of the scene Mr. Hill
was a changed man.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> Modjeska was to have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
week, more if possible. She had to go through
another trial when Mr. McCullough returned,
but the result was a fortnight’s engagement.
On the first night, playing in a strange tongue,
she was quite free from nervousness, and knowing
the part well did it full justice. She sent a
dispatch of a single word, “Victory,” to her
husband; the newspapers pronounced her appearance
“the most confirmed dramatic
triumph that ever occurred in the city”; Sienkiewicz,
then in San Francisco, sent a glowing
letter to his Warsaw paper, and Modjeska’s
American career was launched.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<p>The next morning at eight o’clock an enterprising
theatrical manager called to propose
her appearance in the eastern cities. In December,
1877, after less than a year’s study of
English she appeared as a star in New York.
The story of her career in Poland had been one
of long continued striving, of years of mingled
hard work and disappointment, and of final
brilliant success. In America, by what has become
in stage annals a classical example of will
and courage, she attained equally brilliant success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
in a few weeks, in a foreign land and in a
recently acquired tongue.</p>

<p>It was not long before Modjeska was firmly
established as an international artist—a title
that has been applied with justification to actresses
only very rarely. From this time, in the
early eighties, until the close of the century she
led the life of such an artist—known to the
theatregoers of two continents as no other of
her time save only Bernhardt. Her American
tours brought her before the public throughout
the country, her name was equally familiar in
the various cities of the British Isles, while during
her frequent visits to Poland she acted in
her own tongue among those to whom she had
become one of the country’s glories.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
In seeking the reasons for Modjeska’s brilliant
success and in estimating her as an actress,
one at once recognizes that she was first of all
a woman of great charm, dignity and intelligence.
She was a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grande dame</i>, a woman who
was also a “lady,” in the best sense of that miscellaneous
word. Her friendships in her native
Poland included literally almost every one who
was distinguished or gave promise of being so.
Though born among the people, by unaffected
personal worth she found herself at once at
home among the aristocracy into which she married,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
an aristocracy of genuine breeding and
simplicity. As we shall see, her record of
friendships in England and America was of the
kind that is achieved only by a choice spirit.</p>

<p>Provided she remains herself simple and well-poised,
a woman of this sort, when placed on
the stage, has an obvious advantage in parts
such as Modjeska’s over the woman who with
equal technical ability has not had the same experience
of the world. Without in the least
forfeiting acting ability or a capacity for identifying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
herself with a character, Modjeska was
plainly a gracious and noble-spirited woman.
This quality came over the footlights to her
audience and was one of the secrets of her appeal.
“To mention her name, as the years drift
away, will be to recall a presence of stately dignity,
of tender poetic beauty, of exquisite refinement,
and of perfect grace.... Her ministration
as an actress has taught again the old and
precious lesson that poetry is not a dream.”<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>Modjeska’s art was fine tempered, subtle,
delicate. She was not physically robust, her
voice was not the great tragic voice of a Rachel,
nor had it the thrilling tones of a Mary Anderson.
And there was always between her and
her English speaking audiences the intangible
film of difference of speech, for obviously her
pronunciation could never be perfect. Yet by a
genuinely dramatic insight that was indisputably
hers, a spontaneous naturalness of word
and gesture, and her great power of quiet intensity,
she achieved a forcefulness far beyond
that possible to mere physical and vocal effort.</p>

<p>An example of her individual quality is afforded
by her impersonation of the heroine of
<i>Camille</i>. In the hands of other actresses
the play had seemed “a piece that befogs moral
perceptions and perplexes all sentiments of
right and duty.” Yet Modjeska’s Marguérite
Gauthier redeemed the play and made its heroine
a real and tragic woman. “As we think
upon it,” said William Winter, “there rises in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
fancy a lithe, willowy figure, just touched with a
kind of strange richness—and whose every
movement is perfect grace. The face is pallid
with sorrow; the large, dark, liquid eyes are full
of mournful light; the voice pierces to the heart
in its tones of supplication, and vibrates with
a nameless thrill of despairing agony. This
figure obeys in every motion the feeling that
possesses it. The tumult of self-reproach, the
bitterness of doubt, the ecstasy of contented
and confiding love, the mingled torment and
sublimity of enforced self-sacrifice, the devotion
to virtuous purpose, and the conflict betwixt
earthly hope and heavenly resignation are
all expressed by it with the elements of absolute
sincerity and in a form responsive to the nicest
touch of the guiding thought which controls
every particle of the work. It is impossible to
recognize with too much acceptance the splendid
mechanism with which the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i> acts. It is a
network of movement, attitudes, gestures,
pauses, glances, and quiet, indescribable, subtle
suggestions which, altogether, is faultless in
delicacy and superb in completeness.” This
comes from one who watched Modjeska’s career
with the kindly interest of a friend, but it states
with fairness, if with enthusiasm, the distinctive
qualities of Modjeska’s acting.</p>

<p>Great, however, as were Modjeska’s achievements
as a tragic actress, it was in Shakespearean
comedy, that, in the opinion of many, she
succeeded most individually. Hers was essentially
the imaginative style of acting, and to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Rosalind, Viola, Beatrice and Portia she gave
character and individuality as well as charm
and grace. “To get out of myself,” she said
of her work, “to forget all about Helena Modjeska,
to throw my whole soul into the assumed
character, to lead its life, to be moved by its
emotions, thrilled by its passions, to suffer or
rejoice,—in one word, to identify myself with
it and reincarnate another soul and body, this
became my ideal, the goal of all my aspirations,
and at the same time the enchantment and attraction
of my work.” Thus her Rosalind and
her Viola were not mere graceful, spirited
women. There was, besides, an idealization
that lifted them into the realm of poetry and a
sense of impersonation that was a fitting response
to the imagination with which the characters
were conceived.</p>

<p>With Modjeska’s first American tour began
the formation of that circle of friendships outside
the theatre that would alone mark her as
an extraordinary woman. The names must
suffice: Longfellow, Richard Watson Gilder,
Grant, Sherman, Henry Watterson, Eugene
Field; and in Europe: Tennyson, Lowell, Alma-Tadema,
Burne-Jones, Watts, Justin McCarthy,
George Brandes, Hans von Bülow. With Longfellow,
perhaps, was her most cherished friendship.
During her first visit to Boston he called
on her at her hotel and she and her son went to
his house in Cambridge. “I said I would
gladly study some passages from his poems and
recite them to him, and I mentioned <i>Hiawatha</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
but he stopped me with the words: ‘You do
not want to waste your time in memorizing
those things, and don’t you speak of <i>Hiawatha</i>,
or I will call you Mudjikiewis, which, by the
way, sounds somewhat like your name.’”<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

<p>It was Longfellow who urged Modjeska to
act in London—the very summit of her ambition.
When in 1880 she had repeated there
her American success he wrote to her: “Now
I can add my congratulations on your triumphal
entry into London. How pleasant it
is to be able to say, ‘I told you so!’ And did
I not tell you so? Am I not worthy to be
counted among the Minor Prophets? I cannot
tell you how greatly rejoiced I am at this new
success—this new wreath of laurel.” For London
was immediately won. Public, critics, society
and fellow actors united to make her welcome.</p>

<p>Poland, a small and unhappy country, has
done more than its share in furnishing the
world with artists. With some of the most
famous of them Modjeska’s name is curiously
linked. Paderewski, during her visit to Poland
in 1884, used to come to visit her. He was
then a young man of twenty-one whom it was
impossible to keep away from the piano. She
encouraged him, overcame his doubts as to his
fitness for a public career, and that summer
they appeared in the same program in Cracow.
They were friends during the rest of her life,
and it was Paderewski who in 1905 inspired the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
great farewell testimonial to Modjeska in New
York. “The first encouraging words I heard
as a pianist,” he wrote, “came from her lips;
the first successful concert I had in my life was
due to her assistance.” It was she, too, who
years before, in a Polish mountain summer resort,
first brought Jan and Eduard de Reszke
before an audience. They were both then
under twenty.</p>

<p>In 1893 Madame Modjeska was one of four
actresses<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> who addressed the Women’s Congress
at the Chicago World’s Columbian Exposition.
Besides her appearance before the
Congress as an actress, she was asked to speak
on another occasion as a representative of Poland.
The women who were expected from
Poland evidently feared the Czar’s displeasure
in case they spoke frankly concerning their
country, and failed to appear in Chicago. But
Modjeska spoke her mind freely concerning the
grievances of the Poles. She was widely
quoted in the papers, and news of her speech
reached St. Petersburg. Playing two years
later in Poland, she was about to act in Warsaw
when word came from the Russian government
forbidding her appearance. Plans were made
for an engagement in St. Petersburg itself, but
at the last moment, when large sums had already
been spent in preparation, she was told
that her appearance in the capital was forbidden.
Shortly afterwards Modjeska and her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
husband were ordered to leave Warsaw, and an
imperial decree was issued to the effect that
they were never thereafter to enter any part of
the Russian territory. Efforts were often
made to obtain permission to go to Warsaw, but
to the end of her life Modjeska was excluded
from the Czar’s dominions.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a></p>

<p>In April, 1905, Madame Modjeska, then living
in practical retirement in California, received a
letter signed by a number of authors, fellow
actors and artists in New York which acknowledged
in affectionate terms their debt and gratitude
for her career, and offered her a public
testimonial in New York. This was the idea of
Paderewski, who had visited her in California
but a short time before and like many others
was disturbed by the lack of public acclaim with
which she was modestly sinking into retirement.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
The great pianist, much to his distress,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
was prevented by an accident from being present,
but the best known actors appearing in New
York at the time lent their services. Modjeska
herself played scenes from <i>Macbeth</i> and
<i>Mary Stuart</i>. Edmund Clarence Stedman
presented to Madame Modjeska a memorial
scroll bearing signatures of her many friends,
actors, actresses, and her “attached votaries in
other walks of life—all made associates,” Mr.
Stedman said in addressing her, “by their delight
in your genius and career. A quarter-century
ago you came to us from a land invested
with traditions of valor, beauty, and romance,
from the brave and soulful country that flashed
its sword in our behalf and that in our own
times enthralls us with music,<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> and through
you with impassioned tenderness and artistic
power. The felicities of art are limitless, and,
as in creations of our master playwright you
found the most alluring range for your own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
powers, so your fresh impersonations woke in
us the sense of ‘something rich and strange.’”</p>

<p>Modjeska, with tears in her eyes and her voice
breaking with emotion, briefly expressed her
gratitude.</p>

<p>“Long may your enviable years flow on,” Mr.
Stedman had said. But it was only four years
later that she died,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> in California, where she
had always maintained her home, in a beautiful
country place she called Arden, not far from the
scene of that ill-starred venture which after all
had its justification in giving to America a great
actress. She was buried in Cracow, the city of
her birth.</p>

<p>“Hail to thee upon thy return to thy last resting
place,” said Michael Tarasiewicz at her
funeral, “welcome thou, who might say of thyself
as did Countess Idalia: ‘I am here as a
passing angel. I have let thee see the lightning
and disappeared upon the firmament of the
sky.’... For thy art, for thy constant work,
for that thou hast never become renegade to
thy ideal, and that, in perfecting thy soul, thou
hast been perfecting the soul of humanity, be
blessed.”</p>

<h2 id="ELLEN_TERRY">ELLEN TERRY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">There</span> was, in Sir Walter Scott’s day, an
actor named Daniel Terry, who was a
part proprietor of the Adelphi Theatre in London.
He was furnished funds for that venture
by Sir Walter, and according to Lockhart enjoyed
a large share of Scott’s regard and confidence.
An effort has sometimes been made to
identify this Terry with the family that in the
latter half of the nineteenth century furnished
England with some of her most accomplished
stage artists. But the connection was one of
name only, for Benjamin Terry, the father of
Ellen, was the son of an Irish builder, and
eloped with the daughter of a Scottish minister.</p>

<div id="ip_93" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 30.9375em;">
  <img src="images/i_111.jpg" width="495" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ELLEN TERRY</div></div>

<p>Benjamin Terry and his wife, the parents of
Ellen, were both actors, not reckoned among
the brilliant stars of their day, but respectably
talented, well-trained actors of the old school,
better known in the provinces than in the
metropolis. Benjamin Terry was “a handsome,
fine-looking brown-haired man,” and his
wife “a tall, graceful creature, with an abundance
of fair hair, and with big blue eyes set
in a charming face.” On the outlying “circuits,”
in Edinburgh, and later in the London<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
company of Charles Kean, they were reasonably
successful in their profession; but their
distinction—and a sufficient one surely—is
their remarkable family of sons and daughters.
“Think of it,” wrote Clement Scott; “Kate,
with her lovely figure and comely features;
Ellen, with her quite indescribable charm;
Marion, with a something in her deeper, more
tender, and more feminine than either of them;
Florence, who became lovelier as a woman than
as a girl; and the brothers Fred and Charles,
both splendid specimens of the athletic Englishman.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<p>It was while Benjamin Terry and his wife
were playing in Coventry that, on February 27,
1848, their second daughter, Ellen Alicia, was
born. Coventry is proud of the fact, and there
has been a rather brisk dispute as to which
house was the birthplace.<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p>

<p>From her earliest childhood, Ellen Terry
knew the theatre and its people. She was not
one of those who, like Mary Anderson or Modjeska,
are forced to cherish ambitions in secret,
for naturally and inevitably the theatre absorbed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
her. She and her sister Kate, four
years her elder, were in their early girlhood
as firmly established as popular favorites as
actresses of that age can be.</p>

<p>Ellen Terry’s fame has exceeded that of any
other of Benjamin Terry’s large family, but
when she began her stage career she was naturally
known as Kate Terry’s little sister. Before
Ellen made her first appearance, at the age of
eight, Kate had achieved marked success, for
a child, in Charles Kean’s company, and until
she was twenty-three, when she married and retired
from the stage, she was recognized as one
of England’s leading actresses. The third of
the Terry sisters, Marion, and the youngest,
Florence, had less distinguished but creditable
careers. There has not been a better instance
of the hereditary beauty and talent that occasionally
concentrate in theatrical families.</p>

<p>Benjamin Terry and his wife became members
of the company which about the middle of
the century the younger Kean gathered at the
Princess’s Theatre. Whatever the disappointments
of Charles Kean’s career, he was earnestly
devoted to his art, he greatly developed
the scenic equipment of the stage of his day,
and he made the Princess’s Theatre an excellent
school of acting.</p>

<p>Benjamin Terry not only acted parts at the
Princess’s, but assisted with the productions
and stage management. Naturally enough,
when Kean’s series of Shakespearean revivals<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
required the appearance of children, the young
Terry sisters were chosen. They had received
what training their parents could give them.
“It must be remembered,” Ellen Terry long
afterward wrote, “that my sister and I had the
advantage of exceedingly clever and conscientious parents,
who spared no pains to bring out
and perfect any talents that we possessed.
My father was a very charming elocutionist,
and my mother read Shakespeare beautifully,
and they both were very fond of us and saw
our faults with eyes of love, though they were
unsparing in their corrections. And, indeed,
they had need of all their patience; for my
own part, I know I was a most troublesome,
wayward pupil.” Her father was constantly
calling for impromptu rehearsals of her lines—at
the table, in the street or ’bus—whenever
opportunity came. She remembers vividly going
into a drug store, where her father stood
her on a chair to say her part for the proprietor.</p>

<p>Trained for the stage from her earliest childhood,
and destined unquestioningly for the
career of an actress, her first appearance came
and went so much as a matter of course that
there has remained some uncertainty as to the
date and part. Miss Terry herself declares
for April 28, 1856, and Mamillius, in <i>The Winter’s
Tale</i>. Much painstaking research has
been applied to the question, confirming her
strong impression. Yet Dutton Cook said he
remembered seeing Kate and Ellen Terry as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
the two princes in <i>Richard III</i>, and wrote:
“My recollection of Ellen Terry dates from her
impersonation of the little Duke of York. She
was a child of six, or thereabout, slim and
dainty of form, with profuse flaxen curls, and
delicately featured face, curiously bright and
arch of expression; and she won, as I remember,
her first applause when, in clear resonant
tones, she delivered the lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">‘Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because that I am little, like an ape,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders’<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p class="in0">Richard’s representative [Charles Kean]
meanwhile scowling wickedly and tugging at
his gloves desperately, pursuant to paternal example
and stage tradition. A year or two later
and the baby actress was representing now
Mamillius and now Puck.”</p>

<p>Mr. Cook’s recollection is not borne out by
the play bills, however, and it may safely be
said that Ellen Terry’s first appearance was
as Mamillius when she was eight years old.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
Miss Terry has given us her own impressions
of her first night as Mamillius. “How my
young heart swelled with pride—I can recall
the sensation now—when I was told what I had
to do. There is something in a woman’s nature
which always makes her recollect how she was
dressed at any especially eventful moment of
her life, and I can see myself, as though it were
yesterday, in my little red and white coat—very
short—<em>very</em> pink silk stockings, and a row
of tight sausage curls—my mother was always
very careful that they should be in perfect order
and regularity—clustered round my head. A
small go-cart, which it was my duty to drag
about the stage, was also a keen source of
pride, and a great trouble to me. My first
dramatic failure dates from that go-cart. I
was told to run about with it on the stage, and
while carrying out my instructions with more
vigor than discretion, tripped over the handle,
and down I came on my back. A titter ran
through the house, and I felt that my career as
an actress was ruined forever. Bitter and copious
were the tears I shed—but I am not sure
that the incident has materially altered the
course of my life.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> The <i>Times</i> concluded its
review of the production with the words:
“And last—aye, and least too—Miss Ellen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
Terry plays the boy Mamillius with a vivacious
precocity that proves her a worthy relative of
her sister Miss Kate.”</p>

<p>She had soon played not only Mamillius, but
also Puck in <i>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</i>,
Prince Arthur in <i>King John</i>, Fleance in <i>Macbeth</i>
and other childish parts in plays less well
remembered. “In those days,” says Miss
Terry, “I was cast for many a ‘dumb’ part.
I walked on in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> carrying
a basket of doves; in <i>Richard II</i> I climbed
up a pole in the street scene; in <i>Henry VIII</i>
I was ‘top angel’ in the vision, and I remember
that the heat of the gas at that dizzy height
made me sick at the dress rehearsal! I was a
little boy ‘cheering’ in several other productions....
In <i>The Merchant of Venice</i> I was
firmly convinced that the basket of doves which
I carried on my shoulder was the principal attraction
of the scene in which it appeared.
The other little boys and girls in the company
regarded those doves with eyes of bitter envy.
One little chorus boy, especially, though he
professed a personal devotion of the tenderest
kind for me, could never quite get over those
doves.”</p>

<p>It is not to be thought that the young Terry
sisters were merely attractive and clever children.
They were applauded, wrote Dutton
Cook, “not simply because of their cleverness
and prettiness, their graces of aspect, the careful
training they evidenced, and the pains they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
took, but because of the leaven of genius discernible
in all their performances—they were
born actresses.... Here were little players
who could not merely repeat accurately the
words they had learnt by rote, but could impart
sentiment to their speeches, could identify
themselves with the characters they played,
could personate and portray.”</p>

<p>Thus Ellen Terry’s training began early and
rigorously. “When I was a child,” she wrote
long afterwards, “rehearsals often used to last
until four or five in the morning. What weary
work it was to be sure! My poor little legs
used to ache, and sometimes I could hardly keep
my eyes open when I was on the stage. Often
I used to creep into the green-room, and there,
curled up in the deep recess of the window,
forget myself, my troubles, and my art—if you
can talk of art in connection with a child of
eight—in a delicious sleep.” In the years to
come Ellen Terry rose to distinction first of
all by virtue of her radiant, charming personality
and a natural gift for acting. But only
less important has been the infinitely varied,
toilsome schooling in actual experience, thus
so early begun.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
When Ellen was twelve Charles Kean’s management
of the Princess’s came to an end. Her
parents at once took advantage of the measure
of popularity which the sisters had acquired
and presented them in a “drawing-room entertainment.”
It consisted of two short plays in
which Ellen and Kate assumed all the characters,
of both sexes. The venture was a success,
and the little troupe, father, mother, two
daughters and a pianist, traveled far and wide
throughout the Kingdom for more than two
years, driving from place to place in the primitive
style of strolling players.</p>

<p>Returning to London, Ellen Terry, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
name seems already to have been fairly well
established, had a part at the Royalty Theatre
in a dreadful play founded on Sue’s <i>Atar-Gull</i>.
It was her rôle in this gruesome drama to appear
on the stage wrapped in the coils of a
huge serpent, and shrieking the terror appropriate
to the situation. This was at least an
opportunity for one kind of acting and Miss
Terry made the most of it. The contemporary
accounts show that she shrieked most startlingly
and whole-heartedly.</p>

<p>Kate Terry had joined the stock company at
Bristol, and there Ellen, when she was fourteen,
went also. For a year she had the sound training—the
best an actor can have—of acting
many widely varying parts. “If I had to describe
her acting in those days,” wrote a member
of the company, “I should say its chief
characteristic was a vivacious sauciness. Her
voice already had some of the rich sympathetic
quality which has since been one of her most
distinctive charms. Although only in the first
flush of a joyous girlhood, she was yet familiar
enough with the stage to be absolutely at home
on it.... We, the young fellows of that day,
thought she was perfection; we toasted her in
our necessarily frugal measures; we would
gladly have been her hewers of wood and drawers
of water. She had personal charm as well
as histrionic skill. Her smiles were very sweet,
but, alack for all of us, they were mathematically
impartial.” During this stay in the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
of England (the Bristol company appeared also
at Bath) she acted a wide range of parts, from
Shakespeare to extravaganza. The training, in
quantity and variety, which was afforded by
the stock companies of the middle of the last
century, cannot easily be matched to-day. The
theatrical system of England and America has
been revolutionized, and the long run, the
country-wide tour, the specialized actor, have
become the rule. Only within the last few
years, as in the rise of the Irish national
theatre, the Manchester Players, and the upward
trend in certain American stock companies,
can we see something of a return to
earlier conditions.</p>

<p>There followed a year in London, in the company,
headed by the older Sothern, which was
playing at the Haymarket. She was but fifteen,
yet the <i>Times</i> said: “She is now matured into
one of the happiest specimens of what the
French call the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ingénue</i>.” She played Gertrude
in <i>The Little Treasure</i>, Hero in <i>Much
Ado about Nothing</i>, Lady Touchwood in <i>The
Belle’s Stratagem</i>, Julia in <i>The Rivals</i>, and also
Mary Meredith in a revival of <i>Our American
Cousin</i>, in which Sothern was his famous other
self, Lord Dundreary;—not bad for fifteen!</p>

<p>At sixteen came one of those sudden and
complete absences from the stage that have
strangely marked the career of one born to act.
She was married in 1864 to George Frederick
Watts, the famous artist. He was thirty-one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
years her senior. Watts was a man of great
nobility of character, he cared for her deeply,
and the brief period of her life with him she
herself declared not wholly unhappy. Yet the
marriage was a mistake. Though she responded
to the beauty and peace of her new surroundings,
and for a while at least was contented to
forget the theatre, she was little more than a
child—exuberant, unused to the restraint of a
quiet country home; and she had tasted success.
The artist himself was oppressed with a feeling
that he had spoiled her life. In any event
they soon separated, and she met him only once
thereafter, though years later they exchanged
friendly letters.</p>

<p>When she was nearing twenty Ellen Terry
returned to the stage, more or less under the
direction of Charles Reade, the famous novelist,
then part manager of the Queen’s. One of
the best of English novelists of the second degree,
his main artistic interest was the theatre,
and he was, mistakenly, more ambitious of fame
as a dramatist than as a novelist. His play <i>The
Double Marriage</i> was founded on his novel
<i>White Lies</i>. It was well acted (Ellen Terry
playing the heroine), and well mounted, but a
failure. Charles Reade’s oft-quoted description
of Ellen Terry in a way characterizes them
both, the charming actress and the brusque,
facile writer: “Her eyes are pale, her nose
rather long, her mouth nothing particular, complexion
a delicate brick-dust, her hair rather
like tow. Yet somehow she is beautiful. Her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
expression kills any pretty face you see beside
her. Her figure is lean and bony; her hands
masculine in size and form. Yet she is a pattern
of fawn-like grace. Whether in movement
or repose, grace pervades the hussy.”
The two were to be excellent, even affectionate,
friends.</p>

<p>The most noteworthy event of this brief engagement
at the Queen’s was her first appearance
with Henry Irving, then of course a rising
actor, not yet the distinguished manager of
later days. The play was Garrick’s “mutilation”
of <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i> which he
called <i>Katherine and Petruchio</i>. Of this foreshadowing
of what was to be, Miss Terry
writes: “There is an old story told of Mr.
Irving being ‘struck with my talent at this time
and promising that if he ever had a theatre of
his own he’d give me an engagement!’ But
that is all moonshine. As a matter of fact
I’m sure he never thought of me at all at that
time. I was just then acting very badly, and
feeling ill, caring scarcely at all for my work
or a theatre, or anybody belonging to a theatre.”
And again: “From the first I noticed
that Mr. Irving worked more concentratedly
than all the other actors put together,
and the most important lesson of my working
life I learnt from him, that to do one’s work
well one must <em>work continually</em>, live a life of
constant self-denial for that purpose, and, in
short, keep one’s nose upon the grindstone.”
Of her performance in the pseudo-Shakespearean<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
piece the critics varied. “I have not
much recollection of the performance,” wrote
Clement Scott, “save that Ellen Terry was the
sweetest shrew ever seen and that it seemed
barbaric to crack a whip in her presence.”</p>

<p>After acting for about a year at the Queen’s,
Miss Terry again retired from the stage, this
time for six years. She disappeared from London
and the stage and wholeheartedly gave herself
up to a tranquil domestic life in the country.
This was the period of her union with
Charles Wardell, her second husband, an excellent
actor known to playgoers as Charles
Kelly. Of this union there have been two
children, Ailsa Craig, who played small parts
at the Lyceum with her mother and Henry
Irving, and Gordon Craig, who, first an actor,
is today recognized as one of the most important
and fertile workers toward a new art of
stage setting.</p>

<p>“I led a most unconventional life,” writes
Miss Terry, “and experienced exquisite delight
from the mere fact of being in the country. No
one knows what ‘the country’ means until he
or she has lived in it. ‘Then, if ever, come perfect
days.’... For the first time I was able
to put all my energies into living.... I began
gardening, ‘the purest of human pleasures’;
I learned to cook, and in time cooked very
well, though my first essay in that difficult art
was rewarded with dire and complete failure.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
“My hour of rising at this pleasant place
near Mackery End in Hertfordshire was six.
Then I washed the babies. I had a perfect
mania for <em>washing</em> everything and everybody.
We had one little servant, and I insisted on
washing her head. Her mother came up from
the village to protest. ‘Never washed her head
in my life. Never washed any of my children’s
heads.’</p>

<p>“After the washing I fed the animals. There
were two hundred ducks and fowls to feed, as
well as the children. By the time I had done
this, and cooked the dinner, the morning had
flown away. After the midday meal I sewed.
Sometimes I drove out in the pony-cart. And
in the evening I walked across the common to
fetch the milk. The babies used to roam where
they liked on this common in charge of a bulldog,
while I sat and read. I studied cookery-books<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
instead of parts—Mrs. Beeton instead
of Shakespeare!</p>

<p>“Oh, blissful quiet days! How soon they
came to an end! Already the shadow of financial
trouble fell across my peace. Yet still I
never thought of returning to the stage.</p>

<p>“One day I was driving in a narrow lane,
when the wheel of the pony-cart came off. I
was standing there, thinking what I should do
next, when a whole crowd of horsemen in ‘pink’
came leaping over the hedge into the lane. One
of them stopped and asked if he could do anything.
Then he looked hard at me and exclaimed:
‘Good God! It’s Nelly!’ The man
was Charles Reade.</p>

<p>“‘Where have you been all these years?’
he said.</p>

<p>“‘I have been having a very happy time,’
I answered.</p>

<p>“‘Well, you’ve had it long enough. Come
back to the stage!’</p>

<p>“‘No, never!’</p>

<p>“‘You’re a fool! You ought to come back.’</p>

<p>“Suddenly I remembered the bailiff in the
house a few miles away, and I said laughingly:
‘Well, perhaps I would think of it if someone
would give me forty pounds a week!’</p>

<p>“‘Done!’ said Charles Reade. ‘I’ll give you
that, and more, if you’ll come and play Philippa
Chester in <i>The Wandering Heir</i>.’”</p>

<p>Thus it was “dear, lovable, aggravating,
childlike, crafty, gentle, obstinate, and entirely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
delightful and interesting Charles Reade,” to
use Ellen Terry’s own characterization, who in
1874 induced her to return to the stage. He
was then managing the Queen’s. Since 1868
she had not acted at all, but she was well remembered,
and her reappearance was cordially
welcomed. The play was one of Reade’s
own, <i>The Wandering Heir</i>, and in course of it
Miss Terry appeared in male attire—one of
the few times she had what old timers used
to know as “breeches parts.” From all accounts
it was a buoyant, charming impersonation.
The author complimented her on her
self-denial in making what he called “some
sacrifice of beauty to pass for a boy, so that
the audience can’t say: ‘Why, James must
be a fool not to see she is a girl.’”</p>

<p>From this time, in 1874, until more than
thirty years later, Ellen Terry was continuously
before the public. In 1875, S. B. Bancroft
(later Sir Squire)—one of the ablest
actor-managers of the day—determined upon
a daring experiment at his little Prince of
Wales’s Theatre, a bandbox of a theatre hitherto
dedicated to the “teacup and saucer drama.”
This was his production of <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i>. The play has never been set more
beautifully, and as we shall see, it was in one
part acted to perfection. But it failed through
the failure of Charles Coghlan as Shylock.
For Ellen Terry, however, it was really the
first great triumph of her career. For her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Portia on this occasion was a real triumph.
She was twenty-seven, in the very perfection
of her youth and beauty, and it was her first
important venture with a Shakespearean part.
Her success was immediate, and Portia, in the
minds of many, always remained her most
charming and characteristic impersonation.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
“Success I had had of a kind, and I had tasted
the delight of knowing that audiences liked me,
and had liked them back again! But never until
I appeared as Portia at the Prince of Wales’s
had I experienced that awe-struck feeling which
comes, I suppose, to no actress more than once
in a lifetime—the feeling of the conqueror. In
homely parlance, I knew that I had ‘got them’
at the moment when I spoke the speech beginning:
‘You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I
stand.’ ‘What can this be?’ I thought. ‘<i>Quite</i>
this thing has never come to me before.’ It
was never to be quite the same again. Elation,
triumph, being lifted on high by a single stroke
of the mighty wing of glory—call it by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
name—it was as Portia that I had my first and
last sense of it.”</p>

<p>In spite of Miss Terry’s personal success,
the Bancrofts’ splendid revival of <i>The Merchant
of Venice</i> was short lived. Its thirty-six
performances served, however, to lay firmly
the foundations of Ellen Terry’s fame. Only
three years were to elapse before she made her
epoch-making association with Henry Irving.
She spent first a year with the Bancrofts, helping
them give life to a group of already old-fashioned
dramas, <i>Money</i>, <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>,
<i>Masks and Faces</i>, and <i>Ours</i>. “She enacted
Clara Douglas and Pauline as well as they have
been ever played in our time, and showed us
that the staginess of the stagiest of old plays
can be eliminated by acting so sincere and natural
as that of Ellen Terry.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>Then came, in John Hare’s company at the
Court Theatre, where the other members included
her husband and Charles Coghlan (besides
Mr. Hare himself), two years remarkable
chiefly for <i>Olivia</i>. The success of Mr. Hare’s
venture was doubtful, when suddenly a happy
idea came to him,—a play made from <i>The
Vicar of Wakefield</i>. It was a time of enthusiasm
for the eighteenth century. “We were all
mad about blue china, Chippendale chairs, Sheraton
sideboards, old spinets, and brass fire
irons,” says one writer. “The age was exactly
ripe for <i>The Vicar of Wakefield</i>, and John<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
Hare, with his keen instinct, pictured in his
mind’s eye an ideal Olivia in Ellen Terry.” W.
G. Wills made the play, and made it well. Play,
setting, and acting conspired to make <i>Olivia</i>
one of the best examples of the “play of a period.”
As Olivia herself Ellen Terry was supremely
successful and appealing. Among her
non-Shakespearean characters it undoubtedly
stands first, and for her sake <i>Olivia</i> was introduced
into the Lyceum repertoire, and acted
by Irving and Terry for many years.</p>

<p>It was her acting in this part, indeed, that
immediately preceded and to a degree occasioned
her becoming the chief support of Henry
Irving, who just at this time (1878) became
manager of the Lyceum Theatre. Irving’s ambition
to gather the best possible company made
the choice natural, inevitable indeed. She had
just turned thirty, she was temperamentally
fitted to complement his own peculiarly magnetic
personality, she was thoroughly accomplished,
and she was already universally popular.
It is a question, as says Clement Scott,
“how much of Henry Irving’s success was due
at the outset to the extraordinary influence,
charm, and fascination of Ellen Terry.” They
were one in their enthusiasm for their art, and
they were alike in their artistic prejudices.
Like Irving, she was devoted to the poetic and
romantic drama, as opposed to the realistic,
psychological drama of modern life.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a></p>

<p>Henry Irving and Ellen Terry acted together<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
for twenty-four years. One is used to
being told that the Irving <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">régime</i> at the Lyceum
constituted the most brilliant period of the English
stage during the latter half of the nineteenth century.
Brilliant it certainly was—a
splendidly successful, dignified campaign in
fostering the best English stage traditions.
Yet one cannot but sympathize with George
Bernard Shaw’s regret that Ellen Terry did
not retire from Irving’s company sooner than
she did. “I have never made a secret of my
opinion,” wrote Shaw, “that the Lyceum undertaking,
celebrated as it was, involved, when
looked at from the purely dramatic side of the
stage art, a most deplorable waste of two of the
most remarkable talents of the end of the last
century.” What Mr. Shaw objected to was
the exclusion from the Lyceum repertoire of
modern, radical dramatists, such as Ibsen,
Hauptmann, and doubtless Mr. Shaw himself.
But while he thought that Irving used Shakespeare’s
plays not to interpret the dramatist’s
characters but as frames for figures which were
creations of the actor’s imagination, Mr. Shaw
must needs say of Ellen Terry that “she understood
Shakespeare, and knew how to impersonate
Beatrice, Juliet, Imogen and the rest,
intelligently, charmingly, exactly as they must
have appeared to Shakespeare in his mind’s
eye.” And it is probably true that Ellen
Terry, devoted as she was to her “lovely art,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
as she called it, was not more than casually interested
in the development of the allied art,
that of the dramatist. She disliked Ibsen, and
had no desire for his sake to desert the Lyceum.
“Why did she remain so long?” asks Mr. Shaw,
and replying to himself: “The answer is
found in the fact that the Lyceum, while it did
not call her dramatic faculties into full play,
gave the widest scope for the full development
of a wonderful sense of the picturesque.” In
other words, she was attracted by the romantic
rather than the realistic, the poetic rather
than the psychological.</p>

<p>We have traced the important steps of her
rise to a high place in her profession. How
might one account for the personal element in
this success?—for, trained and accomplished
artist as she was, personality counted heavily
in this progress. Well, there has been, can be,
but one Ellen Terry. In writing of her powerful
charm the words of strong men have run
riot. “I never saw a more enchanting and
ideal creature,” wrote Clement Scott of her
later girlhood. “She was a poem that lived
and breathed, and suggested to us the girl heroines
that we most adored in poetry and the fine
arts generally. Later on, as we all know, Ellen
Terry played Queen Guinevere; but at this
period she was ‘Elaine the fair, Elaine the loveable,
Elaine the Lily Maid of Astolat.’... She
was the Porphyria of Robert Browning and
surely one of the crowned queens in the <i>Morte
d’Arthur</i>. I wish I could paint with pen an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
even vague suggestion of this enchanting personality,
tall, fair, willowy, with hair like spun
gold, a faultless complexion, the very poetry of
movement, with that wonderful deep-toned
voice that has a heart-throb in it.” If in her
’teens Ellen Terry was “ideal, mystical,
mediæval,” and suggested Elaine and Undine,
who that ever saw her, in her later career, as
Olivia, but saw realized in flesh and blood the
ideal of English beauty?</p>

<p>“The rôle which she played in the life of
her times,” says Mr. Shaw, “can only be
properly estimated when (perhaps fifty years
hence) her letters will be collected and published
in twenty or thirty volumes.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Then, I
think, we shall discover that every celebrated
man of the last quarter of the nineteenth century
had been in love with Ellen Terry, and
that many of these men had found in her friendship
the best return that could be expected from
a gifted, brilliant and beautiful woman, whose
love had already been given elsewhere.” And
not only celebrated men. There have been
countless lowly, unknown devotees. “That
much-used word ‘only’ can be used literally in
regard to Ellen Terry,” again says Mr. Shaw
with unusual enthusiasm. “If Shakespeare
had met Irving on the street he would have
recognized in him immediately a distinguished
type of the family of artists; if he had met<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
Ellen Terry he would have stared at her as
at a new and irresistibly charming type of
woman.”</p>

<p>It seems clear that Ellen Terry’s success was
after all one largely of personality. She was
splendidly successful, and no one could for a
moment deny the fascinating beauty of most
of her acting. Yet was she of the first flight of
artists? It is difficult to answer <i>Yes</i>. Her
Portia and her Beatrice were the finest of her
time, probably the finest the stage has yet seen;
her Olivia was a lovely, indeed a perfect, realization
of Goldsmith’s heroine, and in many another
character she charmed and moved her
hearers. Yet when all is said and done Ellen
Terry, in her most successful parts, was simply
her glorified self. It is probably true—though
the question was never thoroughly put to the
test—that she lacked that power, reserved for
the artist of first rank, of identifying herself
equally well with widely differing characters.
True tragedy lay beyond her. Charles Reade,
at one time a constant and helpful critic of her
acting, told her that she was capable of any
effect, <em>provided it was not sustained too long</em>.
“A truer word was never spoken,” says Miss
Terry. “It has never been in my power to
sustain. In private life, I cannot sustain a
hatred or a resentment. On the stage, I can
pass swiftly from one effect to another, but I
cannot fix one, and dwell on it, with that superb
concentration which seems to me the special
attribute of the tragic actress. To sustain,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
with me, is to lose the impression that I have
created, not to increase its intensity.” Always
of a volatile, light-hearted temperament in her
own self, the acting of tragedy was with her
more a matter of routine duty than the natural
response of her nature.</p>

<p>But let us not seem to require too much of a
providence that vouchsafes so rarely an Ellen
Terry. If criticism, when the final estimate is
written, is forced to recognize in her a circumscribed
talent, we who have seen her would not
have had her otherwise than as she was. And
if one says she was not truly a great artist, another
may reply truthfully that with her art
was second, life itself first. “In contrast to
Irving, to whom his art was everything and his
life nothing, she has found life itself more interesting
than art,” says George Bernard
Shaw. “And while she was associated with
him in his long and brilliant management of
the Lyceum Theatre she—the most modern of
modern women—considered it a higher honor
to be an economic, exemplary housewife than
to be a self-conscious woman, whose highest
aim was to play the heroine in the old-fashioned
plays in which Irving shone.” Again, she
lacked that all-sacrificing ambition that carries
the artist to the topmost heights. During her
two absences from the stage, and especially
during the second, when she spent six years in
the country, happy as housewife and mother,
she had no regrets for the stage, no longing for
its triumphs. And she was throughout her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
career content to be a “useful” actress. She
constantly uses that word. She was content,
first with private life, then with her ability to
help the artistic cause of Henry Irving.</p>

<p>Never has there been a better example than
Ellen Terry of the blending of trained acting
ability with untamed high spirits. Her acting
was sure of its effects and yet shot through
with gleams of her own radiant charm and exuberance.
And off the stage as well she was
this same blithe spirit. It was strange that
she disliked the elder Sothern, for if he had
his equal in practical joking, it was in Ellen
Terry. She was thirty when she joined Irving.
Yet one day when he came to the foot of the
stairs leading to her dressing room, he looked
up to see his new leading woman sliding down
the banisters! The act was characteristic, and
so is her comment: “I remember feeling
as if I had laughed in church.... He smiled
at me but didn’t seem able to get over it.”
But sunny as she was, she could weep too.
When playing Olivia, she generally wept, she
says, for the part touched her more than any
other. “I cried too much in it, just as I cried
too much later on in <i>Hamlet</i>, and in the last
act of <i>Charles I</i>. My real tears on the stage
have astonished some people, and have been
the envy of others, but they have often been
a hindrance to me. I have had to <em>work</em> to restrain
them.” She was occasionally oversensitive
to adverse criticism. When a writer in
<i>Blackwood’s</i> said she showed plainly that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
Portia loves Bassanio before he has actually
won her, Miss Terry was, she says, for years
made uneasy and lacking in sureness at this
moment in the play. “Any suggestion of indelicacy
in my treatment of a part,” she wrote,
“always blighted me.”</p>

<p>To trace in detail the history of “Irving and
Terry” would be tedious. They acted together
from 1878 to 1902. Their half dozen American
tours aroused the same enthusiasm and loyalty
that during all that long period was their
portion at home.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> Her retirement is so recent
that the actress’s Portia, her Beatrice, Juliet,
Imogen, Ophelia (to mention only the outstanding
Shakespearean characters) are still fresh
memories.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
It is probably true, as Mr. Shaw maintains,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
that despite the opportunities given her to act
Shakespeare’s most charming heroines, Miss
Terry’s association with Henry Irving really
resulted in reducing her total accomplishment.
Irving sacrificed her as he did himself and
everyone and everything else, to his art. To
be sure he mounted a number of plays—notably
<i>Olivia</i>, <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>, <i>Faust</i>, <i>Madame
Sans-Gêne</i>, and perhaps some of the Shakespearean
comedies—primarily for her sake.
Yet she little better than wasted much time and
effort in playing secondary and unsuccessful
parts in plays selected primarily for him. And,
sorrow of sorrows, Rosalind, whom she was
born to play, he never made possible for her.
How incomparable she would have been!—a
Rosalind of ideal aspect, of delicious high
spirits, of consummate grace and tenderness.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
But it seems, after all, rather futile and ungrateful,
in the face of what has really been,
to cavil about what might have been. Ellen
Terry has actually been one of those rare
spirits who confer a blessing on a gray world
by their mere presence. As a woman she was
lovable, simple, whole-heartedly human, generous,
high spirited; as an actress, uniquely
delightful and in many impersonations, by virtue
of nature and instinct, of compelling power,
even genius. Small wonder that we must reckon
her as one of the great line of English women
of the theatre, the last indeed of that small
and scattered band, who, each in turn, were
the queens of the stage; small wonder, too, that
by thousands of hearts on both sides of the
ocean she has been cherished as an idealized
fellow creature.</p>

<p>When she had at last left Sir Henry she
bade fair to enlarge the scope of her already
well-rounded career by appearing in plays of
a more modern type than any that fell within
the Lyceum’s scope. “When her son, Mr.
Gordon Craig, became a father,” wrote George
Bernard Shaw, “she said that no one would
ever write plays for a grandmother. I immediately
wrote <i>Captain Brassbound’s Conversion</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
to prove the contrary. Once before I had tried
to win her when I wrote <i>The Man of Destiny</i>
in which the heroine is simply a delineation of
Ellen Terry, imperfect, it is true, for who can
describe the indescribable?”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p>When in 1905 Miss Terry played James M.
Barrie’s delightful <i>Alice-Sit-By-The-Fire</i>, it
was felt, by those minded like Mr. Shaw, and
not disturbed by seeing her appear in a play
widely diverging from the Lyceum traditions,
that at last she had come into her own—that
she was doing what she should have done years
before, in giving her talents to a modern
play. And the next year she appeared as Lady
Cecily in the play that Shaw had written for a
grandmother, and that had waited for her
seven years, <i>Captain Brassbound’s Conversion</i>.</p>

<p>She had been an actress fifty years. When
the anniversary approached the English world
of the theatre bestirred itself to mark the date
fittingly. The celebration took the form of an
astonishing entertainment at Drury Lane. The
programme ranged from songs, recitations, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tableaux
vivants</i>, through <i>Trial by Jury</i> and
scenes from <i>The School for Scandal</i>, to an act
from <i>Much Ado</i>, in which Miss Terry herself
was Beatrice, supported by a cast including a
score of the Terry family. The list of those
who appeared on the stage of Drury Lane on
the afternoon of June 12, 1906, is simply a roster<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
of the pick of the actor’s profession in England;
distinguished actors, if nothing more
could be found for them to do, thought themselves
honored to walk on as supernumeraries;
Genée danced; Caruso sang; Signora Duse
came all the way from Florence to pay homage;
the audience, which had begun to gather for
the great occasion as early as the previous
day,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> was overwhelming in its enthusiasm, and
altogether the occasion was an unprecedented
demonstration of loyalty and affection.</p>

<p>Early in the following year (1907) Miss
Terry made her eighth and as an actress her
last tour of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> Three years
later, and again in 1914, she came as a lecturer
reading scenes from Shakespeare and
commenting on his heroines. It was good to
see and hear her again if only on the platform,
even though, as William Winter said,
it is one thing to act, another to expound.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
“To see her as an actress was to see a vital
creature of beauty, passion, tenderness, and
eloquence, a being, in Cleopatra’s fine phrase,
all ‘fire and air.’” On the lecture platform
she was not quite all that, but she was still
Ellen Terry, imperial of figure, rich of voice,
buoyant of mood.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> As such her public in
England and America saw its last of her.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
She is now living quietly in one of those small
country houses the “collection” of which has
been one of her hobbies. She has given in generous
measure pleasure to many, many thousands;—more
than pleasure, inspiration indeed,
to countless men and women. The realization
of this must be a great reward, to make happy
the twilight of her life.</p>

who would learn the language of the

and manners of Paris, to harken while he gave
them this advice: “Go and see Réjane. Don’t

  <div class="caption">GABRIELLE RÉJANE</div></div>

<p>Madame Réjane—the Parisienne: they are interchangeable
terms. And what is a Parisienne?
Let our sprightly French friend—M.
Dauphin Meunier—tell us; he does it well:<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<p>“A fabulous being, in an everyday human
form; a face, not beautiful, scarcely even pretty,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
which looks upon the world with an air at once
ironical and sympathetic; a brow that grows
broader or narrower according to the capricious
invasions of her aureole of hair; an odd little
nose, perked heavenward; two roguish eyes,
now blue, now black; the rude accents of a street-girl,
suddenly changing to the well-bred murmuring
of a great lady; abrupt, abundant gestures,
eloquently finishing half-spoken sentences;
a supple neck—a slender, opulent figure—a
dainty foot, that scarcely touches the earth
and yet can fly amazingly near the ceiling; lips,
nervous, sensuous, trembling, curling; a frock,
simple or sumptuous, bought at a bargain or
created by a Court-dressmaker; a gay, a grave
demeanor; grace, wit, sweetness, tartness;
frivolity and earnestness, tenderness and indifference:
such is Woman at Paris: such is the
Parisienne.</p>

<p>“No need for her to learn good manners, nor
bad ones: she’s born with both. According to
the time or place, she will talk to you of politics,
of art, of literature—of dress, trade, cookery—of
finance, of socialism, of luxury, of starvation—with
the patness, the sure touch, the absolute
sincerity, of one who has seen all, experienced
all, understood all. She is as sentimental as a
song, wily as a diplomat, gay as folly, or serious
as a novel by Zola. What has she read?
Where was she educated? Who cares? Her
book of life is Paris; she knows her Paris by
heart; and whoso knows Paris can dispense
with further knowledge.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Réjane was from the beginning a veritable
child of Paris. She was born on June 6, 1857,
at 14 <i>Rue de la Duane</i>, in a business section of
the city. This street had been “one of the storm
centers for almost every great riot known to the
Paris of the last century and a half.” The little
Gabrielle Charlotte Réju passed her infancy in
that busy part of Paris between <i>Porte Saint-Martin</i>
and <i>Place Château d’Eau</i>.</p>

<p>Her parents were poor. Her father had
earlier been an actor and at one time had directed
a theatre at Arras.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> When Gabrielle was
born, and during the years of her infancy, he
was the ticket-taker and the keeper of the buffet
at the <i>Ambigu</i>. In the work of dispensing refreshments
Madame Réju, who came of a good
Valenciennes family, actively assisted, and even
Gabrielle herself, when she grew old enough, was
pressed into service.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<p>With the home life virtually transferred to the
lobbies of the <i>Ambigu</i>, it was inevitable that
Gabrielle, breathing the mystery-filled atmosphere
of a theatre, should at once feel its strong
influence. Like Ellen Terry and Mrs. Fiske,
and unlike her compatriot the great Sarah, Réjane
was, from the beginning, of the theatre.
She was an amiably mischievous child, possessed
of an immense curiosity about life behind the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
scenes. She remembers vividly those early
days, in which she divided her time between her
small duties, napping in corners, and revelling
in the delights that presented themselves over
the footlights. There she saw many of the stars
of the day, Jane Essler, Frédérick Lemaître,
Marie Laurent, Adèle Page. On the night of a
new production, between the acts, she would go
to her mother and recount the story of the play
and give childish imitations of the various players.
To imitate the fine gowns she saw on the
stage, she would make a train from the buffet
napkins. One of the memories of her childhood
is the enchantment that possessed her when she
saw herself, dressed in a velvet robe and a royal
diadem, reflected in Adèle Page’s splendid
cheval glass.</p>

<p>When Gabrielle was about five, her father
died, and mother and daughter were thrown on
their own resources. Mme. Réju secured a position
at one of the other theatres, and Gabrielle
went to school. She was to some extent in the
care of a friend, but she was privileged with extraordinary
liberties. Her mother gave her a
franc each morning with which to buy her evening
meal, and it was with immense pride that
she would go forth alone to take her dinner at a
restaurant. Often she would save enough from
her franc to buy an orange which she would take
with her into the balcony of the <i>Ambigu</i>, where
she was still privileged to go. There she would
tarry to see an act of the play before she went
home.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
It is clear that she was a precocious, clever
child. She was already, indeed, an actress.
Her evening walk would invariably take her past
her beloved <i>Ambigu</i>. She made an event of this
passage, putting on her best attitudes and smiles
for the artists who might be seated in the terrace
of the café.</p>

<p>This café of the <i>Ambigu</i> was the scene of one
of the oft-repeated episodes of Réjane’s childhood.
The proprietor, a relative of some sort,
was in the habit of beating his wife. One evening,
Gabrielle, who knew what to expect, happened—as
was not unusual—to be in the café.
Soon the poor woman’s cries were heard as her
lord and master belabored her. A patron demanded
of Gabrielle what the terrible noises
meant. “Oh, that, Monsieur,” she said.
“Why, they’re rehearsing upstairs.”</p>

<p>Soon the mother changed her work, and took
up the painting of fans. Between sessions of
the school, and all day on Thursdays, little Gabrielle
helped in this work and proved herself
adept. They received for this work about fifty
cents per dozen fans. Madame Réju seems to
have been sensitive as to her new work. She and
her young daughter, too proud to have it known
that they were doing work of that sort, or perhaps
for fear of offending certain rich relatives,
took a neighbor into their confidence and paid
her for delivering the fans to <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">la maison Meyer</i>.</p>

<p>If mother and daughter had continued to live
in the immediate neighborhood of the <i>Ambigu</i>
it is not unlikely that the already lively ambition<span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span>
of the girl would have found its outlet at that
theatre. We have seen something of her enthusiasm
for the <i>Ambigu</i> and her close relationship
with its entourage. Once launched upon
her career there as an actress of popular drama,
she would very likely have remained there and
missed the valuable training that she was to
receive at the <i>Conservatoire</i>. As it happened,
however, when she was about ten her mother
moved from <i>Rue de Lancry</i> to 17 <i>Rue Notre-Dame-de-Lorette</i>,
and in large measure the influence
of the <i>Ambigu</i> was removed.</p>

<p>On the same floor with Madame Réju and her
daughter in their new quarters lived a lady with
whom they gradually formed a close friendship.
When the war of 1870 broke out, the new friend
left Paris, leaving her apartment in charge of
Mme. Réju and Gabrielle. There the windows,
unlike those of Mme. Réju’s own suite, overlooked
the street. When the Commune brought
the terrors of civil war to Paris, it was from
these windows that the child witnessed what
was to her a terrible and long-remembered
sight, a street battle between the government
troops and the Communists. The bodies of
slain men, carried past under those windows,
gave her her first glimpse of death.</p>

<p>The war past, Gabrielle, now fourteen, returned
to school at the <i>Pension Boulet</i>, <i>Rue
Pigalle</i>. She applied herself diligently to her
somewhat neglected studies, and to such good
purpose that the mistress of the school, with
whom Gabrielle had become a favorite, offered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
her a position as an assistant with the younger
pupils. She was to be paid forty francs a
month, and her luncheon. To her mother this
seemed to be the opening of an honorable career.
Not so Gabrielle herself, who cherished constantly
her already fixed ambition to be an
actress. She was, however, fond of children,
and to tide affairs over she took a class of the
younger pupils. She got along well enough
with them with their ordinary lessons, but her
own instruction in sewing and embroidery had
been neglected, and she had to have the help of
the older of her pupils, to bridge the gap.</p>

<p>Occasionally, of a Sunday evening, Gabrielle
was taken by her mother to the house of a friend
who gathered about herself a modest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salon</i>.
There came such men as Félicien David, the
composer, Joseph Kelm, the writer, and the
architect, Frantz Jourdain. Gabrielle, young
as she was, with her natural gayety and spontaneity
at once took her place in the circle. She
would sing for the assembly the popular songs
of the day—compositions often full of doubtful
meanings that she very imperfectly understood.
Her little successes naturally strengthened her
longing to be an actress, to stir great houses as
she amused this little circle of friends.</p>

<p>To Gabrielle’s increasing ambition her mother
set herself in opposition. To her mind the forty
francs per month was not lightly to be sacrificed.
And she said she did not care to be the mother
of an actress. She lived to own herself in the
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
One evening, as mother and daughter were
passing the <i>Théâtre Français</i>, they saw a crowd
at the stage door. They questioned a bystander
and were told that this had been the farewell
performance of Regnier. Gabrielle insisted on
waiting to see him come out. She had never
seen him, but every one knew of Regnier, great
artist and lovable personality. Soon he appeared,
a little, old man, who got up into his
carriage and acknowledged the ovation with a
modest and confused air. Gabrielle never forgot
her first and touching glimpse of the man to
whom she was soon to owe so much.</p>

<p>The struggle with her mother over her cherished
plan to go on the stage went on for another
year. A Mlle. Angelo, a friend of Mme.
Réju, attempted to make peace by offering
Gabrielle a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dot</i> of 10,000 francs if she would
accept a plan to marry as a solution of the difficulty.
But Gabrielle refused to be bought off,
and steadfastly clung to her ambition, with the
result that the mother at last gave in.</p>

<p>The friend from whose windows Gabrielle had
seen the battling Communists had returned to
Paris and now took up the girl’s cause. She introduced
Gabrielle to Charles Simon,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> who knew
well the actor Regnier, now an honored teacher
at the <i>Conservatoire</i>. The girl was duly introduced
to Regnier, who received her affably but
tried to dissuade her from attempting the career
of an actress. He was unable to overcome the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
ardent resolution of Gabrielle, and finally consented
to receive her, for two months, on the condition
that if at the end of the time she failed
to convince him of her calling she would promise
to give up the attempt for good and all.
Sure of success, she promised.</p>

<p>Regnier’s first task was to cure his pupil of
a thickness of diction. For hours every day she
practiced enunciation, but found her master
hard to please. Nevertheless he must have seen
promise in her, for during the summer (of
1872) he wrote to Charles Simon that when
classes assembled he would receive Gabrielle as
a regularly enrolled pupil. When the <i>Conservatoire</i>
reopened, she passed her entrance examination
by reading the rôle of Henriette in <i>Les
Femmes Savantes</i>, and was admitted. Here
began, when she was fifteen, the serious work
of her career.</p>

<p>She was an ardent pupil. Not content with
the regular course, she and her mother squeezed
their narrow means that the girl might amplify
her studies with a number of private lessons
with Regnier at his house. He gave her the
lessons, but when she offered to pay, he refused
to accept. “One does not accept pay,” he said,
“when he is privileged to deal with the temperament
of an artist.” And, thus, the trial months
past, Regnier, instead of sending Gabrielle
packing, engaged himself to teach her as best
he could, gratis, till her period as a student
should end.</p>

<p>In January (1873), came the annual elimination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
examination. Gabrielle, like the rest, submitted
to the test that weeded out the less promising
pupils. She had a rôle—that of Agnes—not
altogether suited to her, her dress was not
too well chosen, she was at the most awkward
of ages, and she was by no means the prettiest
girl of the lot. Gazing at her, Edward Thierry,
director of the <i>Comédie Française</i>, said in a
doubtful tone to Regnier, “Do we keep <em>this</em>?”
“Yes,” promptly replied Regnier, “she is in my
class and she stays.” At the end of the school
year came the annual competition. For her part
in the preliminary examination Regnier chose
<i>L’Intrigue Épistolaire</i>. Thierry, again one of
the judges, failed to recognize her and said,
“This child is charming! She is the hope of
the competition.” And, imitating his colleague’s
former doubting tone, Regnier now
said, “We keep <em>this</em>, then?”</p>

<p>In the competition itself Gabrielle, in this
same scene of <i>L’Intrigue Épistolaire</i>, fell just
short of a prize and received a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">premier accessit</i>,
or honorable mention,—not bad for a
girl just turned sixteen and a mere beginner.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<p>In this competition Mlle. Legault won the
first prize in comedy and with it a post at the
<i>Comédie Française</i>. Her departure left vacant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
a scholarship of 1,200 francs. In the same
competition her successor to the scholarship
was to be determined. Regnier had resolved
to get the scholarship, if possible, for Gabrielle.
The professors who sat in judgment
were forbidden by a rule of the <i>Conservatoire</i>
to impart personally any news of the outcome.
Such information was to come only from the
administration. Regnier, however, conspired
with his favorite pupil to relieve her of suspense.
If she were the successful candidate
for the scholarship he was to rub his nose as
he left the building. After the meeting, therefore,
she stood anxiously in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">porte-cochère</i>,
awaiting her teacher and the behavior of his
index finger. Imagine the importance of the
moment to the rather shabbily dressed, not too
well-fed, nervously anxious girl. To stay her
hunger as she waited she was eating bits from
a long loaf tucked under her arm. First came
M. Legouvé, who, by a curious chance, rubbed
his nose briskly as he left the building. Then
came MM. Beauplan and Ambroise Thomas, and
each, oddly enough, suddenly gave his nose a
vigorous rub. Gabrielle wondered, but could
not believe that all these demonstrations were
for her. Finally, out came Regnier, smiling,
and slowly rubbing his nose with the end of his
forefinger. For the moment the loaf of bread
had been forgotten. Now she waved it aloft,
dancing about in an ecstasy of joy.</p>

<p>The winning of the scholarship made it possible
for Gabrielle to go on with her studies in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
the two months’ interval that preceded the reopening
of the <i>Conservatoire</i>.</p>

<p>Francisque Sarcey was discerning enough to
note the promise in this sixteen year old girl.
He said of her, in speaking to the playwright
Meilhac: “She has a face you would know as
Parisian a mile off ... and she is full of the
devil. If this girl doesn’t make her way, I shall
be much surprised.... She is charming; she is
piquant; and if I were a manager I would engage
her out of hand.”</p>

<p>To eke out the family income, Gabrielle had
two pupils, youngster though she was. They
were young girls from Gascony, and it was her
task to cure them of their un-Parisian accent.
She remembers that one day when she was on
her way to her pupils, the omnibus passed a
church. The crowd about the door, and the
numerous flowers, denoted a funeral. “They
are burying Desclée,”<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> said a fellow passenger.
Gabrielle had seen Desclée in some of her notable
successes:—<i>Froufrou</i>, <i>La Femme de
Claude</i>, <i>La Princesse Georges</i>—and had been
stirred to renewed ambition by her art. So now
she was tempted to alight and pay her respects
to the dead actress’ memory; but she
remembered her lesson, and went on to her pupils.</p>

<p>Her last year (1873–4) at the <i>Conservatoire</i>
Mme. Réjane remembers not only for its months<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
of hard study but for an incident or two that,
trivial in themselves, had considerable importance
in her youthfully ambitious mind. One
morning Regnier called on her to recite “<i>La
Fille d’Honneur</i>,” a poem she had memorized
by hearing it often spoken by a fellow pupil.
She was horribly nervous. Her own two pupils
were present, as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">auditrices</i>, and Gabrielle feared
the usual frequent interruption of Regnier, who
as a rule made his pupils repeatedly go back
over imperfectly recited passages. This time,
however, he allowed her to proceed to the end,
which agitated her still more, and then he said
in a solemn tone as if pronouncing a final judgment
on her: “<i>C’est très bien, ma petite;
descends, tu seras une grande artiste</i>.” Réjane
says that the intense joy of that instant never
was equaled afterwards, even in the moments
of her greatest triumphs.</p>

<p>The pupils of the <i>Conservatoire</i> were permitted
to accept engagements to play on Sundays
at the little theatre of the <i>Tour-d’Auvergne</i>.
There it was that Gabrielle made her
first public appearance. The play was <i>Les
Deux Timides</i>, and in acting it she had the inexpert
assistance of Albert Carré. In the middle
of the piece M. Carré was seated at a desk, writing
a letter, when his nose began to bleed. He
bolted from the stage, leaving the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">débutante</i>
alone to face her first audience in the midst of
a staggering contretemps. Advice was hoarsely
whispered from the wings to do this or that, to
walk off, to sit down, to wait for Carré; Gabrielle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
coolly seated herself and took up the
writing of the letter until, a moment later, the
bleeding stopped, Carré returned.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a></p>

<p>When the concours of 1874 arrived—the annual
prize contest of the <i>Conservatoire</i>—Gabrielle’s
progress had been such that her fellow-students
and her professor all thought her sure
of the first prize in comedy. Regnier chose for
her one of Roxelane’s scenes in <i>Les Trois Sultanes</i>.
When she had finished she felt that she
had done herself scant justice. Then the unexpected
happened. She was also to appear in
a dialogue called <i>La Jeunesse</i>, by Emile Augier.
A youthful couple met at a fountain. The
young man says: “Cyprienne!” She exclaims:
“Ah! Mon Dieu!” Gabrielle delivered this
commonplace speech with such a sincerity and
intensity of emotion that the audience broke
into applause. Reassured, she played the dialogue
through to the end with a command of
emotional acting that surprised even her
friends, for she had been thought of as only a
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>, a soubrette.</p>

<p>When the prizes were announced, Gabrielle
found that she had not only missed getting the
first comedy prize, but that she was to get only
a share of the second; the other half was to go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
to Mlle. Jeanne Samary, she “of the perfect
laugh.”</p>

<p>Regnier was chagrined. “<i>Malfaiteurs</i>,” he
called the judges. And some of the newspaper
comment showed a recognition of unusual merit
in the young Réjane. Sarcey, the reigning king
of the Paris critics, had again been present, and
<i>Le Temps</i> rang with his praises of her. And
his praises were perhaps better than official
prizes. A score of years later, M. Meunier
wrote:</p>

<p>“To-day, as then, though twenty years have
passed, there is no possibility of success, no
chance of getting an engagement, for a pupil on
leaving the <i>Conservatoire</i>, unless a certain all-powerful
critic, supreme judge, arbiter beyond
appeal, sees fit to pronounce a decision confirming
the verdict of the Examining Jury.... He
smiles or frowns, the Jury bows its head. The
pupils tremble before this monstrous Fetich—for
the Public thinks with him, and sees only
through his spectacles; and no star can shine
till his short sight has discovered it. This puissant
astronomer is Monsieur Francisque Sarcey....</p>

<p>“Monsieur Sarcey smiled upon and applauded
Réjane’s début at the <i>Conservatoire</i>. He consecrated
to her as many as fifty lines of intelligent
criticism; and I pray to Heaven they may
be remembered to his credit on the Day of Judgment.
Here they are, in that two-penny, half-penny
style of his, so dear to the readers of
<i>Le Temps</i>:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
“‘I own that, for my part, I should have
willingly awarded to the latter (Mlle. Réjane)
a first prize. It seems to me that she deserved
it. But the Jury is frequently influenced by
extrinsic and private motives, into which it is
not permitted to pry. A first prize carries with
it the right of entrance into the <i>Comédie Française</i>;
and the Jury did not think Mademoiselle
Réjane, with her little wide-awake face, suited
to the vast frame of the House of Molière.
That is well enough; but the second prize which
it awarded her authorized the director of the
<i>Odéon</i> to receive her into his company; and that
perspective alone ought to have sufficed to dissuade
the Jury from the course it took....
Every one knows that at present the <i>Odéon</i> is,
for a beginner, a most indifferent school....
Instead of shoving its promising pupils into it
by the shoulders, the <i>Conservatoire</i> should forbid
them to approach it, lest they should be lost
there. What will Mademoiselle Réjane do at
the <i>Odéon</i>? Show her legs in <i>La Jeunnesse de
Louis XIV</i>, which is to be revived at the opening
of the season? A pretty state of things.
She must either go to the <i>Vaudeville</i> or to the
<i>Gymnase</i>. It is there that she will form herself;
it is there that she will learn her trade,
show what she is capable of, and prepare herself
for the <i>Comédie Française</i>, if she is ever to
enter it.... She recited a fragment from <i>Les
Trois Sultanes</i>.... I was delighted by her
choice. <i>Les Trois Sultanes</i> is so little known
nowadays.... What wit there is in her look,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
her smile! With her small eyes, shrewd and
piercing, with her little face thrust forward, she
has so knowing an air, one is inclined to smile
at the mere sight of her. Does she perhaps
show a little too much assurance? What of it?
’Tis the result of excessive timidity. But she
laughs with such good grace, she has so fresh
and true a voice, she articulates so clearly, she
seems so happy to be alone and to have talent,
that involuntarily one thinks of Chenier’s line:
“<i>Sa bienvenue au jour lui rit dans tous les
yeux</i>.”... I shall be surprised if she does not
make her way.’”</p>

<p>Second prize or first, it mattered not, really;
for she had, almost at once, offers from three
theatres: the <i>Odéon</i>, the government theatre
that by the conditions of the award had a right
to her services, and also from the <i>Vaudeville</i>
and the <i>Gymnase</i>. M. Duquesnel of the <i>Odéon</i>
proposed, as Sarcey had predicted, that she take
a part in the impending <i>La Jeunesse de Louis
XIV</i>. Réjane, however, declined to cut short
her studies at the <i>Conservatoire</i>, which had yet
a few weeks to run.</p>

<p>Her choice fell to the <i>Vaudeville</i>, as the
theatre best suiting her methods and sympathies.
Also, the pay there was to be four
thousand francs per year, and costumes, as
against one hundred and fifty francs per month
at the <i>Odéon</i>. With the directors of the <i>Vaudeville</i>
she signed a provisional contract, by the
terms of which she was to join their forces if the
<i>Odéon</i> did not press home its claim to her.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
Weeks passed, the October openings came
round, and still there was no summons. In her
anxiety she went to the office of the Minister of
Fine Arts and from him obtained a letter releasing
her, in two days’ time, from her obligations
to the <i>Odéon</i>. Before the two days were
up, however, she received from Duquesnel a summons
to a rehearsal of <i>La Jeunnesse</i>. Réjane
hastened to see him. “Well,” he said, “we
shall rehearse to-morrow at one.” Réjane replied
that she had one at the <i>Vaudeville</i> at the
same hour. Duquesnel objected to the loss of
his promising recruit and showed an official letter
bestowing her services upon the <i>Odéon</i>.
Gabrielle in turn showed the letter from the Minister.
Duquesnel was forced to yield, but afterwards
lodged a suit in which the <i>Odéon</i> was
awarded damages. “So,” said Réjane to Jules
Huret, “if the <i>Odéon</i> can to-day boast its velvet
chairs, it has me to thank for them.”</p>

<p>And so Réjane began her career, when she
was less than eighteen, with a two years’ engagement
at the <i>Vaudeville</i>. Her first few
rôles<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> were unimportant, and in them she attracted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
no particular notice, but in September
(1875) she appeared in <i>Madame Lili</i>, a one-act
play in verse, to such good purpose that Sarcey
wrote of her: “Mademoiselle Réjane is charming,
with her roguery, her ingenuousness, her
tenderness. This pretty and piquant girl is
spirited to her fingertips. What a piece of good
luck it is that she cannot sing; for if she had
a voice operetta would gobble her up.”</p>

<p>Yet Regnier wrote to her in the following
April, on the day following her appearance in
<i>Le Premier Tapis</i> (in which she sang an interpolated
song by Lecocq): “I was really astonished<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
by your singing. You had better cultivate
this talent, which I didn’t know you had.”
Offenbach also heard her in this piece, and liked
her singing so well that he offered her twenty
thousand francs a year for her signature to a
contract at the <i>Variétés</i>. Luckily she made no
attempt to break her contract with the <i>Vaudeville</i>.</p>

<p>That contract she renewed again and again
until she had played eight seasons at the theatre
of her first choice. The best guide to her growing
art, and to the beginnings of her fame, are
found in her letters from Regnier, who followed
her career with loving watchfulness, and often
with frank, kindly comment on her work. Their
correspondence forms a charming chapter of
her youth.</p>

<p>Regnier’s birthday fell on the first of April.
Every year Réjane wrote to him on March 31
and sent him some small gift. In the year when
she was beginning her work at the <i>Vaudeville</i>
he wrote her:</p>

<p>“Ought you really send me presents, my
child? Do I need assurances of your affection?
Do follow my advice, dear girl, save your money
and give me nothing but your friendship. That
is the only present I desire from you and, I warn
you, it is the only one I shall accept in the future.
You hope to be able to celebrate my birthday
for many years to come. I hope so too.
You will never have a better friend, a better adviser,
and no one, save only your mother, will
ever bear your welfare more at heart. I thank<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
you, none the less, and with all my heart I embrace
you.”</p>

<p>At the close of a health-seeking trip she took
in Holland and Belgium in the summer of 1875
he wrote: “I knew you would get many new
impressions. You must always be on the search
for like ones, for your spirit, your ideas, your
taste, your talent will thus find themselves.
Frequent our museums, stimulate your mind,
read a great deal, even do a little writing.
Such is the intellectual regimen that will profit
your soul as the exercises I have advised will
benefit your gentle body.”</p>

<p>Less exalted advice comes after <i>Le Verglas</i>
and <i>Le Premier Tapis</i>, besides the commendation
of her singing in the latter piece: “Keep
at your study and your work and let me repeat
that it is the simple and the veracious that brings
the true effect. But I was more than satisfied
with you yesterday. <i>But</i>, please remember
your carriage—don’t waddle on one leg and
then on the other; don’t swallow your syllables
and your words. Pronounce everything without
affectation, but also without negligence. I
embrace you.”</p>

<p>After she had been a year and a half in harness,
he was still emphasizing the fundamentals.
After <i>Le Perfide comme l’Onde</i> he wrote (November
26, 1876): “You are very pretty and
very amusing in your rôle.... <i>You are a comédienne</i>,—that
you have proved. Between ourselves,
the other young ladies frightened me a
bit. Do not you allow yourself to fall into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
general carelessness of carriage and pronunciation.
Really talk to those to whom your words
are addressed, and when your eyes peer into the
auditorium remember it is a vacuum, and never
talk to any one therein. You know how to
avoid this fault, so look out for it, and remain
natural. But you played well, were applauded,
and deserved to be.”</p>

<p>Her work must have pleased the directors of
the <i>Vaudeville</i>, for when the time came to renew
her contract she signed for nine thousand
francs, a considerable advance over four thousand.
Her mother, however, had set her heart
on nine thousand six hundred francs, and her
objections threatened to break off the negotiations.
Réjane promised, however, unknown to
her mother, to repay the disputed six hundred
francs during the engagement.</p>

<p>“I economized on cress,” she relates. “Instead
of getting two boxes at three sous apiece,
I got two boxes at five sous. From time to time
I put fifteen centimes into my boots. And one
fine day I carried to the managers one hundred
and fifty laboriously collected francs. I must
say, to their credit, that they wouldn’t take the
money. But my mother never knew, and sometimes,
endeavoring to crush me with the superiority
of a strong-minded woman, she would
say: “There now! Without me, you would
never have had those six hundred francs.”</p>

<p>In the summer of 1877 she grew nervous over
the forthcoming production of <i>Pierre</i>. She
wrote Regnier from Abbeville: “If you could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
only give me one hour for the third act of
<i>Pierre</i>. The nearer the time approaches, the
more I fear that act—all sentiment. If I am
unsupported by your good advice, my dear master,
I cannot answer for myself.”</p>

<p>Regnier was eager to help her; and in his response
he gives her more fatherly advice: “My
greatest wish is to help you in your work....
But is it necessary for you to go to La Bourbelle,
where you will stay hardly two weeks? The
time seems to me much too short for serious
treatment. Can’t you simply betake yourself to
the waters of Enghien?</p>

<p>“Talk this over with your doctor: ask him
if it is really good for the nerves that that
abominable musk or amber odor which perfumes
your letters should permeate your whole
system. No doubt the odor is agreeable, but
still that is a matter of taste.”</p>

<p>The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">première</i> of <i>Pierre</i> proved the first crowning
success for the young actress. Immediately
after the performance, unable to restrain her
overflowing joy, she wrote to Regnier this enthusiastic
letter:</p>

<p>“I have just had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">grand succès</i>, and I don’t
wish to sleep before thanking you, to whom I
owe it. I have never been so happy as I am
tonight, and I believe that, if such a thing is
possible, even my affection for you has grown.
One thing alone distresses me, and that is my
inability to repay you for all you have done.
At each burst of applause, I thought of you,
dear master, who have given me your time and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
made sure for me my future. No affection has
ever been more profound nor any gratitude so
sincere, believe me. Without you I would have
been nothing, but with you—two hours ago they
told me I was an artist! I can open my heart to
you. You cannot imagine how much is included
in that one word “artist” especially to a young
girl, who yesterday had doubts about the future
and had need of reading all your letters in order
to give courage.... I am doubly happy. Do
not mistake for vanity the effects of the great
joy I have been experiencing. How I would
work, dear master, to do you the honor of registering
a multitude of such nights!”</p>

<p>But good parts fell to Réjane’s lot only infrequently.
The reigning queen of the <i>Vaudeville</i>
was Mme. Bartet, and it was she, naturally, who
got most of the leading rôles. The public had
begun to like the young newcomer, whom it
had come to know in her small but repeated successes;
but nevertheless she was kept more or
less in the background, encouraged only by Regnier
and patiently waiting her opportunities.</p>

<p>It was in this fashion that she spent the remaining
time at the <i>Vaudeville</i> until she left it
in the spring of 1882. That period, whatever
dissatisfactions it brought to her, is not without
its high lights. In <i>Le Club</i> she has “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">un vrai
rôle</i>,” and played it, with gratifying success, a
hundred times. In April, 1879, Mme. Bartet
fell suddenly ill, and with only a few hours notice
Réjane assumed the older woman’s rôle in
<i>Les Tapageurs</i>. When <i>Les Lionnes Pauvres</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
was revived, in November 1879, her Séraphine
aroused one of those artistic controversies which
delight the French mind. Sarcey disapproved,
for once. M. Defère advised her to change her
costumer. M. Barbey d’Aurevilly on the other
hand said she recalled Rachel and was a true
artist; Augier, the author of the play, sustained
her; and stanch old Regnier wrote her at length,
discoursing on the art of acting and of his <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">affection
véritable</i>. Her Mimi in <i>La Vie de Bohème</i>
again saw the critics at odds about her.</p>

<p>Altogether in her eight seasons at the <i>Vaudeville</i>,
she had played more than a score of parts,
some of them genuine successes. Yet she had
not won genuine recognition at the hands of the
directors, and her position in the company was
hardly in accord with her promise and deserts.
Sardou and the others responsible for the affairs
of the <i>Vaudeville</i> seemed strangely blind
to the fact that in Réjane they had a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>
of the first order. But though she was by her
superiors much of the time either kept idle or employed
in almost insignificant parts, the rest of
Paris speedily knew her for what she was. She
was in keen demand for all the special, semi-informal
performances that make up so large
a part of the artistic life of the normal Paris.
The “spectacles” of the <i>Cercle de la rue Royale</i>,
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">revues</i> at the <i>Epatant</i>, the dramatic trifles
that were the adjuncts of authors’ readings, all
found in Réjane a willing and able helper. She
took these artistic informalities seriously, rehearsed
for them and costumed them with care,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
and was so particularly well adapted to the work
that she became a marked favorite with the very
social and artistic circles to which the <i>Vaudeville</i>
catered.</p>

<p>As the directors, however, continued to give
her insignificant parts, it is not strange that she
listened to those friends, like Pierre Berton,
who urged her to shake the dust of <i>Vaudeville</i>
from her feet. “You are a star,” Berton told
her. It happened that a star was the quest just
then of M. Bertrand of the <i>Variétés</i> and with
him she signed a three years’ contract.</p>

<p>This moment may be said to mark the definite
arrival of Réjane. She was no longer to cool her
heels in the greenroom or at home, and henceforth
she was to play, as a rule, principal parts.
Moreover, the agreement with the <i>Variétés</i> was
elastic enough to allow appearances at other
theatres, often in plays of more import than the
light material of which the <i>Variétés</i> was the
avowed medium. And when she returned, on
occasion, to the <i>Vaudeville</i>, it was not in minor
rôles. Réjane had assumed her due place on the
stage of Paris.</p>

<p>It had not been a difficult rise. Though it is
not possible to overlook the elements of steadfast
ambition, patience, and hard work in
Réjane’s early career, it is true that her native
spirits, her <em>flair</em>, and the training and friendship
of Regnier made inevitable her right to a
prominent place on the stage of Paris.</p>

<p>With that place assured, we see her thenceforth
steadily enlarging it, progressing from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
part to part, appearing now in this theatre of
Paris and now in that, shortly venturing into
the other capitals of Europe, then making a
tour—to be later repeated—in America, and
finally acquiring a theatre of her own in Paris,—an
international figure, a queen of comedy.</p>

<p>M. Porel, whom Réjane afterward married,
has given a graphic account of one of her
earlier triumphs—and a typical Parisian first
night. The play was de Goncourt’s <i>Germinie
Lacerteux</i>, the date, 1888; the theatre the <i>Odéon</i>.</p>

<p>“Oh, that première! The beautiful theatre
was crowded to the last inch with an audience
that was restless and seemed none too good-natured.
The journalists were furious because
the dress rehearsal had been behind closed
doors. The women were puzzling themselves
about the subject of the play, and some of the
literary gossips were loudly telling all they
thought they knew. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cafétiers</i> of the neighborhood,
disgruntled because the usual five <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entr’actes</i>
had been cut down to two, were protesting
to the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">claque</i> against the change, which
interfered with the sale of the usual five bocks.
Amid the confusion of the lobbies were heard
remarks that the piece was impossible.</p>

<p>“The curtain rises; Réjane makes her appearance,
with her arms as red as those of a
kitchen-girl. In the ball gown of a servant-maid
she is indeed amazing. This little scene
she plays well, and wins applause. In the scene
of the fortifications, some of the hissers are in
evidence before she enters; and then Réjane, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
prettily modest, plays her idyllic scene so well
that the delighted audience breaks into cries of
‘Bravo!, and the curtain is raised and raised
again.... In one of the following scenes, some
of the audience refuse to listen to Mme. Crosnier;
she becomes confused, loses her head and
begins over again. Some cry aloud, some laugh,
some hiss. Without Réjane the piece will go on
the rocks. A gesture, a poignant, sincere cry,
and Réjane has the house with her again. They
applaud her, they recall her again and again.
During the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">entr’acte</i>, there is a stormy time.
Antoine is indignant over the sneering of his
neighbors and calls them scoundrelly imbeciles.
There is shaking of fists, challenges are exchanged,
some hiss, others applaud. It is in
this atmosphere that the scene in the creamery
begins. Then it was that she quite won the
house. She is again recalled again and again,
applauded by the whole audience. She is acclaimed
again, after the fall of the curtain in
the scene of the <i>Rue du Roiher</i>. The ladies
were completely upset; they wept, they clapped
their hands. Even without Réjane, the two last
scenes finished themselves somehow. After
that, de Goncourt’s play was to live more than
one night; and after that Réjane was assuredly
a great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>.”</p>

<p>Two years later, when <i>Ma Cousine</i>, a comedy
in three acts by Henri Meilbac, was produced,
Paris saw that Réjane had again made extraordinary
progress. “Playing,” says M. Huret,
“in a vast auditorium, a rôle that demanded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
large dramatic power, she responded to that
demand, and, exhibited new poise, control of
voice, and exactness of articulation. She who
had heretofore almost expired of apprehension
at each new impersonation, was now calm, sure
of herself, almost indifferent. She sensed the
authority that had come to her; she held the
audience in her hand. In <i>Décoré</i>, in <i>Monsieur
Betsy</i>, she had been one of a remarkable trio
of actresses; now, in <i>Ma Cousine</i>, she outshone
her <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">confrères</i> at all points. The author had set
her the difficult task of playing an act three quarters
of an hour long without rising from her
couch. But she was equal to the occasion, and,
by the intelligence and sprightliness of her inflections,
gestures and facial expression, she
made that chair itself a miniature theatre.” It
was in <i>Ma Cousine</i> that Réjane introduced on
the boards of the <i>Variétés</i>, after careful study,
a bit of dancing like that on view at the <i>Elysée-Montmartre</i>;
“she seized on and imitated the
grotesque effrontery of Mlle. Grille-d’Egout.”
In other words the sprightly Gabrielle performed
a veritable can-can.</p>

<p>A little later M. Meunier, who was not remarkable
for his kindness in print to the dean
of his craft, wrote: “Sarcey’s exultation knew
no bounds when, in 1890, Réjane again appeared
in <i>Décoré</i>. Time, that had metamorphosed the
lissom critic of 1875 into a round and inert mass
of solid flesh, cruel Father Time, gave back to
Sarcey, for this occasion only, a flash of youthful
fire, which stirred his wits to warmth and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
animation. He shouted out hardly articulate
praise; he literally rolled in his stall with pleasure;
his bald head blushed like an aurora borealis.
‘Look at her!’ he cried, ‘See her malicious smiles,
her feline graces, listen to her reserved
and biting diction; she is the very essence
of the Parisienne! What an ovation
she received! How they applauded her! and
how she played!’ From M. Sarcey the laugh
spreads; it thaws the skepticism of M. Jules
Lemaître, engulfs the timidity of the public, becomes
unanimous and universal, and is no longer
to be silenced.”</p>

<p>The day of Réjane’s greatest and most lasting
success came with the production, in 1893,
of <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i>, by Sardou, the latest of
the Parisian dramatists to answer the call of
the great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i> in their midst.</p>

<p>“Just as the first dressmakers of Paris measure
Réjane’s fine figure for the costumes of her
various rôles, so the best writers of the French
Academy now make plays to her measure,”
wrote M. Meunier in 1894. “They take the size
of her temperament, the height of her talent, the
breadth of her acting; they consider her taste,
they flatter her mood; they clothe her with the
richest draperies she can covet. Their imagination,
their fancy, their cleverness, are all put at
her service. The leaders in this industry have
hitherto been Messrs. Meilhac and Halévy, but
now M. Victorien Sardou is ruining them. <i>Madame
Sans-Gêne</i> is certainly, of all the rôles
Réjane has played, that best suited to bring out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
her manifold resources. It is not merely that
Réjane play the washerwoman, become a great
lady, without blemish or omission; she <em>is Madame
Sans-Gêne</em> herself, with no overloading,
nothing forced, nothing caricatured. It is portraiture;
history.</p>

<p>“Many a time has Réjane appeared in cap,
cotton frock, and white apron; many a time in
robes of state, glittering with diamonds; she
has worn the buskin or the sock, demeaned herself
like a gutter heroine, or dropped the stately
curtsey of the high-born lady. But never, except
in <i>Madame Sans-Géne</i>, has she been able to
bring all her rôles into one focus, exhibit her
whole wardrobe, and yet remain one and the
same person, compress into one evening the
whole of her life.”</p>

<p>What sort of woman presented herself to the
gaze of her Parisian admirers—and soon to
American eyes—at this, the time of her greatest
triumph? Whatever other gifts she brought to
her work, sheer beauty was not one of them.
“Is it her beauty?” asked M. Filon, seeking the
source of her power, and of her perfect understanding
with her audiences. “Certainly not.
She is not pretty; one might even say ... but
it is more polite not to say it. To quote a famous
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">mot</i>, ‘She is not beautiful, she is
worse.’”<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
Though Réjane never had the least claim to
Mr. Vance Thompson’s rhapsodic description
of her as “amazingly and diabolically beautiful,”
she really has no quarrel with the fate
that made her as she is. Comedy was to be her
mission, and if Wilde was right in his dictum
that “what serves its purpose is beautiful,”
beautiful she is, after all. For plain though it
be, her face is a true comedy mask. “There is
comedy in every line of her face, in the arched
eyebrows, the well opened, dancing eyes, the tip-tilted
nose, and the wonderful, mobile, expressive
mouth,” says William Archer. “This
mouth is unquestionably the actress’ chief feature;
it conditions her art. With a different
mouth she might have been a tragedian or a
heroine of melodrama, which would have been
an immense pity. It is not a beautiful feature
from the sculptor’s point of view; even from the
painter’s it is not so much a rose-bud as a full-blown
rose. It has almost the wide-lipped expansiveness
of a Greek mask, but it is sensitive,
ironic, amiable, fascinating.”</p>

<p>To others, her eyes have been her chief charm.
They are large and gray, changeful with the
flexibility of Réjane’s whole nature, surmounted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
by extraordinarily lofty and expressive brows,
and often half covered by eyelids almost languorous.
Her hair is, or at least was, golden
brown. She is not tall. She is by no means
commanding in figure. There is nothing of the
imposing stage queen about her; yet, in figure, as
in face, she has been perfectly equipped for her
work as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne de Paris</i>. Being just that,
she makes her hands and her body means to her
histrionic ends. Those who have repeatedly
studied her art have found the subtlety, the distinction,
and the perfect command of her gestures
and her poses more than a match for even
the brightness, or the sadness or the tenderness
of her face. In every critique of Réjane there
crops out a pointed reference to her wonderful
fluency and flexibility of style, her fertility of
invention of expressive detail, the naturalness
of her transitions of mood. “Elasticity, dexterity
and rapidity she has in a superlative degree,
and with them grace and geniality, together
with simple pathos and honest heat of
temper. And of course she possesses that peculiar
fineness of taste which belongs to her nation
and which is very apparent in <i>Madame
Sans-Gêne</i>, whose heroine may be crude and uncultivated,
but is never boorish or clownish, is
awkward but not ugly. Her voice is clear and
pleasant, but her elocution is less distinct than
that of many other French artists, although her
tones mark unmistakably the spiritual and intellectual
differences which fluctuate through her
speeches. She has an unfailing regard for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
proportions of her scenes, and never obtrudes
herself into a prominent place just because she
is the star of the company.”<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>We have heard much of the comic finesse of
Réjane’s <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i>. Now listen to
one acute observer (Arthur Symons) of another
side of her genius: “Réjane can be vulgar, as
nature is vulgar; she has all the instincts of the
human animal, of the animal woman, whom man
will never quite civilize.... Réjane, in <i>Sapho</i>
or <i>Zaza</i> for instance, is woman ... loving and
suffering with all her nerves and muscles, a
gross, pitiable, horribly human thing, whose
direct appeal, like that of a sick animal, seizes
you by the throat at the instant in which it
reaches your eyes and ears. More than any
actress she is the human animal without disguise
or evasion; with all the instincts, all the natural
cries and movements. In <i>Sapho</i> or <i>Zaza</i> she
speaks the language of the senses, no more....
In being <i>Zaza</i>, she is so far from being herself
(what is the self of a great actress?) that she
has invented a new way of walking, as well as
new tones and grimaces. There is not an effect
in the play which she has not calculated; only,
she has calculated every effect so exactly that
the calculation is not seen.”</p>

<p>M. Filon confessed himself baffled by the question
of whether Réjane’s marvelous liquidness
of mood and method is due to something essential
in her nature, or merely to an incomparable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
power of imitation. “If I shut my eyes,” he
says, “I sometimes think I can hear the nasal
intonation, the little squeaky voice which belonged
to Céline Chaumont. A minute later this
voice has the cadence, the sustained vibration,
the artistic break with which Sarah Bernhardt
punctuates her diction, and the transition is so
skillfully managed that all these different women—the
woman who mocks, the woman who trembles,
the woman who threatens, the woman who
desires, the woman who laughs, and the woman
who weeps—seem to be one and the same
woman. For the matter of that, I have set myself
a problem which I should not be able to
solve even with the help of Réjane herself.
Let us be content with what lies on the surface.
I am inclined to think that her resources consist
of a host of petty artifices, each more ingenious
and more imperceptible than the last.
If one studied her secret one might draw up a
whole set of rules for the use of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédiennes</i>.”</p>

<p>With <i>Sans-Gêne</i> among her achievements,
more and more word of her became known outside
of France. Unmitigatedly French though
she was, though there was little in her to suggest
the universal appeal that has made world
artists of other actresses, by the sheer merit
of the thing she did, and because she was so
complete an epitome of one phase of her nation’s
art, she was bound to become an international
figure. Her first appearance in London was in
June, 1894. Her <i>Sans-Gêne</i> there instantly
won her the recognition she deserved. America<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
had not long to wait. On February 27, 1895
she appeared in <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i> in New
York. She remained there several weeks, playing
in <i>Divorçons</i>, <i>Sapho</i>, <i>Ma Cousine</i>, the one
act play <i>Lolotte</i>, and <i>Maison de Poupée</i> (Ibsen’s
<i>A Doll’s House</i>), besides <i>Sans-Gêne</i>.
Ten years later<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> she made her second and last
tour in America. In the meantime Belgium,
Denmark, Holland, Germany, Russia, Austria,
Roumania, Italy, Spain and Portugal had all
seen her. Regnier’s nose rubbing had assuredly
been to good purpose.</p>

<p>One may as well admit at once that Réjane’s
tours in the United States were not successful,
in the sense that continuously crowded houses
indicate success. The language was, of course,
one stumbling block, for a keen understanding
of the foreign tongue was more necessary for a
taste for Réjane than for the broad effects, say,
of a Bernhardt or a Salvini. And if the language
fell on baffled ears, the essence of the
plays, in some cases, antagonized the more puritanical
of our public. For the pieces Réjane
played reflected a society and a point of view
for which many Americans found it hard to
muster much sympathy. So meager was the
American response to Réjane’s art during her
first visit that she forswore us forever. Nine
years sufficed to make her change her mind.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
“But now (1904) as then,” said the New York
<i>Times</i>, “she is hampered by the moral bias of
American audiences, and by the fact that the
manners she so searchingly studies and exquisitely
depicts are exotic—foreign alike to
our sympathies and our experience.”</p>

<p>Whatever her popular success in America
may or may not have been, Réjane—in some of
her parts at least—won the enthusiastic praise
of the critics and of the restricted public that
knew its French well enough to meet her on
something like Parisian terms. The <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">pièce de
résistance</i> of the first tour was <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i>.
Like most of Sardou’s later dramas, it
was a “tailor-made” play, written to suit the
personality and methods of its principal actress.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
A secondary object was evident in the
effort to take advantage of the revival of interest
in Napoleon that marked, for no evident reason,
the early nineties. Technically the play
was interesting chiefly as showing the author
in a new phase, for it was surprising to find
Sardou, a notorious disciple of Scribe, writing
a piece that was little more than a series of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
sketches. But Réjane lifted the whole affair
to a height at which it could be regarded only
as one of the triumphs of the nineteenth century
theatre.</p>

<p>Réjane’s freshness, naturalness, tenderness,
and charmingly subtle sense of comedy as Catherine
Hubscher in <i>Madame Sans-Gêne</i> was instantly
recognized and celebrated in every
American city that she visited. In <i>Ma Cousine</i>,
a light farce, she acted the soubrette <i>Riquette</i>
with an abandon, a cleverness, a joyousness,
that emphasized her new public’s admiration
of her. Her Nora, however, in <i>Maison de
Poupée</i> (Ibsen’s <i>A Doll’s House</i>), revealed
her in a new and more serious light, demonstrating
at once her genuine versatility and her considerable
emotional power. Even the unsavory
<i>Sapho</i> she made something new and different,
“moderating its excesses and enhancing its
better moods. Less pathetic directly than by
suggestion, she often moved by simple means
a sympathy which <i>Sapho</i> ill deserved.”</p>

<p>Just before Réjane began her second American
tour she had an unhappy experience in
Havana. She gave there a series of eight performances,
the total result being chronicled in
the American papers as a “fiasco.” She had
a welcome such as no actor or actress had ever
before received in Cuba. Thousands gathered
at the pier as a private steamer went out to
meet her and bring her ashore; formal addresses
of welcome and bouquets were showered
on her; and the Havana papers were full of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
odes and eulogies. The first-night audience
that gathered to see <i>Sapho</i> was the most brilliant
ever seen in Havana, and the applause that
greeted Réjane’s entrance was prolonged and
hearty. But the audience grew colder and
colder as the play progressed. The next day
began a festival period for the dramatic critics
of Havana. They pounced upon <i>Sapho</i> and
Daudet, its author, and declared that while his
sort of “esoteric rot” might be what Frenchmen
regard as the product of genius, they rejoiced
that such stuff could not pass as art in
Havana.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Matters grew worse with <i>La Pétite
Marquise</i> and <i>Zaza</i>, the company and the mediocre
productions were abused (“What did the
actress mean by leaving everything except her
costumes in New York?” the papers asked.
“Does she believe that ‘any old thing’ is good
enough for Havana?”), and the young ladies
of Havana were all kept away from Réjane’s
improper plays. Personalities became frequent
in the papers, and one critic boldly asserted
that Réjane’s star had set. Her manager
made matters worse by revoking the
passes of one paper, the lady herself provoked
more criticism by her refusal to be a guest at
a reception at the Athenæum, and altogether
affairs reached such a pass that every one was
immensely relieved when Réjane and her company
sailed away for New York. The whole
incident indicated more than anything else the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
narrow outlook of the Cubans. “We are making
our political independence apply to everything,”
wrote one of the critics. “America for
the Americans, and Cuba for the Cubans! Let
the foreigner get out!”</p>

<p>When Réjane reached America her audiences
found that she could not altogether conceal the
traces left by the flight of time—she was now
forty-seven—but that she had suffered no loss
of her vivacity and power. The tour of 1904–05
was not, however, the improvement over that of
ten years earlier that had been hoped for. The
enthusiasm of American audiences was not to
be won over by the cynicism and frankness of
such pieces as <i>Amoureuse</i>, though the critics
were not slow to recognize the subtle and convincing
quality of Réjane’s work even in that
play, which Mr. Winter gently characterized as
“filthy trash.”</p>

<p>An unexpected circumstance gave new emphasis
to the half-heartedness of her welcome
in the United States. It was simply a bit of
bad luck for Réjane, an injustice to a distinguished
woman and artist, and an illustration
of the influence of American newspaper publicity.
James Hazen Hyde, then in the public
eye because of his share in the insurance scandals,
was—as he has always since been—a generous
patron of the American study of French
literature. He gave a dinner in New York to
honor the actress whose claim to honor none
knew better than he. It was said that on behalf
of himself and his guests he gave her a diamond<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
crown. Accurately or not, it was reported
next day—and the news was not slow in
traveling,—that Réjane’s gratefulness and Gallicism
took the form of her doing a sprightly
dance on the table. The incident was not important,
but the wide publicity given it did not
tend to increase Réjane’s hold on that part of
the public to which she had, on her merits, so
good a claim.</p>

<p>To get all the scandal over with at once, let
us dispose of Réjane’s husband. In 1892 she
had married M. Porel, who had been an actor,
then director of the <i>Odéon</i>, and then of <i>Grand-Théâtre</i>.
Soon after the marriage he became
co-director of the <i>Vaudeville</i> and the <i>Gymnase</i>.
Early in the marriage there were two children,
a daughter and a son. On more than one occasion
Madame Réjane began divorce proceedings,
which were halted when friends intervened
and kept the couple together in the interest of
the children or of the parents’ professional welfare.
Finally both sued for divorce. After
many preliminaries the husband was granted
the decree, though, eventually at least, the children
were left with the mother.</p>

<p>Naturally, the <i>Vaudeville</i> was no longer open
to her. But, as Arnold Bennett (then not yet
the distinguished novelist) wrote in <i>P. T. O.</i>,<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a>
though “Réjane may now and then suffer a
brief eclipse, she can be absolutely relied upon
to emerge in a more blinding glory. Exiled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
from her proper home, the <i>Vaudeville</i>, she naturally
wanted a theatre. She has got it. She
took hold of the <i>Nouveau Théâtre</i>, the unlikeliest
and one of the most uncomfortable theatres
in Paris—the Lamoureaux concerts alone have
succeeded there. She removed everything from
within its four walls, and presently frequenters
of the <i>Rue Blanche</i> observed that the legend
<i>Théâtre Réjane</i> had been carved on its façade.
Last week she announced to her friends (that
is to say, to Paris) that she would be ‘at home’
on such and such a night. The invitation added,
‘Comedy will be played.’ Her friends went,
and discovered the wonderfullest theatre in the
town, incredibly spacious, with lounges as big
as the auditorium, wide corridors, and a scheme
of decoration at once severe and splendid.
Réjane was written all over it, even in the costumes
of the women attendants. Paris was
charmed, astounded, electrified; and now
Réjane flames a more brilliant jewel than ever
in the forehead of the capital.”</p>

<p>There, during the past ten years, she has appeared
in more than a score of new plays, none
of them, perhaps, a new <i>Sans-Gêne</i> or <i>Marquise</i>,
but each serving to keep in vigorous use one of
the rarest talents of the time. During this
time, too, she has acted in South America
(1909), and occasionally, and as recently as the
spring of 1915, she has gone to London, where
she has always been appreciated, sometimes to
act in the regular theatres, and sometimes to
give in the music halls one-act pieces like<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
<i>Lolotte</i>, and scenes from the longer plays.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a>
“Madame Réjane long since announced to the
world, by publicly going about with a grown-up
daughter, that she meant no more to depend
for even the smallest part of her charm
and her power upon the semblance of youthfulness,”
wrote Mr. Bennett in 1906. “She is a
middle-aged woman, and she doesn’t care who
knows it.” She is now even more certainly a
middle-aged woman, but she still has much of
her essential vitality, and of the force of a distinguished
personality.</p>

<p>Off the stage Madame Réjane has always been
a gracious and likable woman, of a gentle, polished
manner and lovable disposition that do
not always go with a pronounced and much applauded
personality. She has a summer place,
“<i>Petit Manoir</i>,” a large, semi-Elizabethan villa
at Hennequeville, near Trouville, on the Normandy
coast. There it has been her habit to
live quietly whenever her engagements permitted,
with her daughter Germaine and her
son Jacques. She has always indulged a taste
for <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">objets de vertu</i>. “When not with her
children or at the theatre,” says Huret, “she
is likely to find time to go in search of paintings,
or books or fine fabrics, a curious old fan, a bit
of unique lace, or a rare flower or jewel, with
the joyous ardor that she puts into everything
and, as in her art, spending immense energy to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
achieve the exquisite and the delicate, in a word,
everything that makes for the joy of working
and of life.” The “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">joie de travaille</i>” is one
characteristic of the great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i> that is
likely to escape the casual public. But work
hard she did, and she made her company work
hard. “On the road” it was the regular thing
to have daily rehearsals, no matter what familiarity
with the plays had been attained.</p>

<p>“The amazing variety of her artistry has
been expressed,” says Huret, “by two famous
portraits of her, one by Chartran, the other by
Besnard. You could paint nothing more strikingly
truthful than these portraits, yet you cannot
dream how unlike they are.... Besnard
has retained only those traits of his sitter which
give her an expression that is energetic, even a
little brutal and sensual,—the popular Réjane,
the Réjane of the <i>Ambigu</i>, of realistic drama,
the Réjane of <i>La Glu</i> and <i>Germinie Lacerteux</i>.
Despite her silk gown and all her finery, Besnard
has seen her with the down-at-heel cloth
boots that Germinie wore to third-rate balls,
and in the white floss-silk gloves which, to get
a realistic touch, she had borrowed from her
servant-maid. That Réjane he has caught admirably!</p>

<p>“But it is not thus that she has appeared to
Chartran. He has seen her in a dainty lace
head-dress adorned with a rose-colored ribbon,
her hair loose over her eyes, her mobile mouth,
her gracious oval face. Above all he has seen
her extraordinary and complex eyes, now quick,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
now velvety, now perverse beneath their large,
languorous eyelids: eyes that are mocking, ardent,
sparkling and dreamy. This is the
Réjane of Meilhac’s plays, the Réjane who is
of the line of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédiennes</i> of the eighteenth century;
it is <i>Ma Cousine</i> who is about to become
<i>Amoureuse</i>.</p>

<p>“And this astonishing complexity of temperament
is reflected in her childhood, in her
life, and in her tastes to-day. The youngster
who passed her evenings in the balcony of the
<i>Ambigu</i> sucking an orange, who stood in ecstasy
before the glass of Adèle Page, and who for
years dreamed of such a life as the acme of
luxury,—her one sees in the portrait by Besnard.
But the young lady of the <i>Conservatoire</i>,
the favorite pupil of Regnier, who won her first
success in <i>L’Intrigue Épistolaire</i>, the elegant
and finished interpreter of the life of the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">salons</i>
and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">cercles</i>, the full-grown <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i> of <i>Marquise</i>:
all these live in the painting of Chartran.”</p>

<p>“<i>Ces deux jolis noms d’une seule et même
personne: Réjane, Madame Sans-Gêne</i>”; thus
one of her countrymen happily characterized
her. But another was just as right when he
called her “the innumerable Réjane.”</p>

<h2 id="ELEONORA_DUSE">ELEONORA DUSE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">When</span> the American papers announced, in
the spring of 1914, that Eleonora Duse
had recovered her health and was contemplating
a return to the stage, the news had a curious
effect, somewhat as if the New York press
had casually said that “Ada Rehan and Mr.
Daly’s company are to play <i>The Taming of the
Shrew</i> next Monday.” A little later the cable
brought the announcement that Bernhardt was
thinking of coming again to America, and
though Mme. Sarah is almost old enough to be
Duse’s mother, the news of her coming had not
the same effect of turning the clock backward.
For Bernhardt is apparently one of the earth’s
permanent phenomena, like the return of vegetation
in the spring; while the tragic figure of
Duse, though she played in America only a
dozen years ago, seems somehow to belong to
the last generation.</p>

  <div class="caption">ELEONORA DUSE</div></div>

<p>She is, however, not yet really an old woman,
for she was born October 3, 1859. The genius
of strange and hard experience, which has attended
her all her life, was present even at her
birth, for it occurred in a third-class carriage of
a railway train, near Vigevano, while her parents,
the members of a band of actors, were on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
their way from Venice to Milan. A troubled
life then began.</p>

<p>For two generations, at least, her forebears
had been player-folk, of a rather humble station,
most of them. An uncle was a player
differing greatly in kind from his famous niece,
for he was known throughout Northern Italy
as an uproariously funny comedian.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Her
grandfather, Luigi Duse, was of a somewhat
more serious turn, and of a more important
rank in the profession, for he is said to have
founded the Garibaldi Theatre at Padua. He
founded also a troupe of Venetian dialect
comedians which was famous for many years.
His four sons were all actors, and one of them,
Eleonora Duse’s father, was a painter as well.
Ultimately he left the stage to devote himself
to that art. Duse’s mother, too, was an actress,
and, after her child was baptized<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and had attained
the age of ten days, resumed her place
in the company, which now had another prospective
member added to its roster. Literally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
Duse knew the theatre and its people from the
first day of her life, and was forced into its
service as a matter of course.</p>

<p>The father and mother were humble strolling
players who wandered about, often on foot,
making a scanty living. The young Eleonora’s
childhood was thus filled on the one hand with
poverty, often hunger, and on the other hand,
with the actor’s trade under her observation
and a part of her daily instruction.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Hers was
really not a childhood at all, a fact that helps
to explain the note of melancholy and tragedy
that has pervaded her whole life.</p>

<p>A career as a stage child, however, seems to
be the thing that produces the notable actress,—the
Siddons, the Terry, the Mrs. Fiske,—if
only the added something is present to endow
the unconsciously absorbed technique with the
significance of personality and high intelligence.</p>

<p>At seven Eleonora was the prompter of the
company. But she soon began to absorb the
words and something of the meaning of certain
rôles. At ten she was playing Cosette in <i>Les
Misérables</i>. By the time she was twelve she
was regularly appearing on the rustic stages,
often impersonating characters far older than
herself. There was much in the old life of the
strolling players that made for joyousness—witness
Modjeska’s tribute to her early experience
of such life—and the young Duse was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
not without her gay moods, in those days, but
responsibility, hard work and the impersonation
of adult and much-troubled women, while
she was still in her middle ’teens, inclined her
toward the seriousness that has characterized
her life. When she was fourteen her mother
died, and her duties as <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tragédienne</i> were supplemented
by the care of younger children. Is
it any wonder that she soon seemed to be
“walking through life like a somnambulist”?<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p>Before she was sixteen she had acted a round
of tragic parts, among them Doña Sol, Francesca
da Rimini (in the play by Pellico) and
Caverina, the heroine of Victor Hugo’s <i>Angelo</i>.
When she was just over sixteen she played
Juliet, in Verona itself. The theatre—it was
the “Arena,” an open-air theatre—was
crowded, and the actress roused the assembly
to enthusiasm by a Juliet that was girlish, beautiful
and natural.</p>

<p>But her term of what we would call “barnstorming”
was not to end yet. The vagabondage
continued, varied first with a tour of Dalmatia,
and then by an occasional engagement,
in small rôles, apart from the family company.</p>

<p>In 1879, when she was twenty, the company
she had joined was playing in Naples. Here,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
for some reason, its leading actress was lost to
it, on the eve of the presentation of <i>Thérèse
Raquin</i>. To Duse, in the emergency, was assigned
the part of Thérèse. The stage—that
of the old Florentine Theatre—was a famous
one; Salvini and Ristori had often trod its
boards. And she was to face the most discerning
public that had yet seen her. The result
was in the way of recompense to Duse for her
years of struggle and poverty. Cesare Rossi,
one of the distinguished men of the theatre in
the Italy of his day, was present. Immediately
he offered to place her under his own management.
Duse’s years of apprenticeship may be
said to end at this point, for from now on her
progress was steadily upward.</p>

<p>Her marriage, which came at this time, when
she was about twenty, was only a brief interruption.
It was another touch of tragedy in
Duse’s life. With her, “it has been difficult to
choose the point when the make believe of the
theatre ended and the reality of life began.”
Her husband was a Signor Checchi, an actor of
mediocre ability. A daughter was born, but
the marriage was to Duse a great disappointment.</p>

<p>Back to the stage she went, after this time of
trial, with little heart for her work, though
Rossi had given her a good contract. Then, in
1880, while she was in Turin, she saw Bernhardt
in <i>La Princesse de Bagdad</i>, one of the
plays by which the younger Dumas was making
inroads on the old-fashioned classical repertoire.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
Duse at once announced her intention
to play in the same piece. The resulting negotiations
with Dumas served not only to introduce
some of his plays—of course translated
into Italian—into the theatre in Italy, but to
begin a warm though curiously impersonal
friendship between the author and the rising
young actress. She conceived the most ardent
admiration for the man and his work, and it
was not long before he was urging her to try
her fortunes in Paris. Many years were to
elapse before she was to make that venture, for
very good reasons, as will later appear.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<p>Dumas, it would appear, and the success with
which she made his plays, <i>La Princesse de Bagdad</i><a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a>
and <i>La Femme de Claude</i>, understood and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
liked in Italy, had a large share in restoring her
interest in life and her work, and in increasing
her fame. She was rapidly becoming known
throughout Italy. By the time of her first venture
outside of Italy—which took her to faraway
South America<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a>—she had achieved success
in Turin, in Rome and in Milan.</p>

<p>As yet there was little thought of her as other
than an Italian for the Italians. Dumas’ appeals
to act in Paris had always been in vain.
If reports of her acting had been carried home
by visitors from the great capitals, she was
not thought of, as yet, as a world’s actress.
To carry plays to Moscow, to Vienna, to Berlin,
and act them there effectively in a foreign
tongue, an actress must needs be of great power,
must have a genius that makes itself felt above
all differences of speech. In 1892 she went to
Vienna, comparatively unheralded, and from
there word went forth that a new and great
actress had come from her native Italy and
blazed into a sudden glory. Francisque Sarcey,
the distinguished French critic, had followed
the company of the <i>Comédie Française</i>
to Vienna, and from there wrote to
the <i>Temps</i> accounts of her display of versatility
in playing equally well <i>Antony</i> and
<i>Cleopatra</i>, <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i> (“<i>Camille</i>”)
and <i>Divorçons</i>. Sworn admirer of Bernhardt
that he was, he easily found faults in Duse,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
but he praised her justly too: “She is not
handsome, but has an intelligent and expressive
face and wonderful mobility of features.
Her voice is not particularly musical,
but its occasional metallic vibrations produce
thrilling effects. Her diction, like Mme. Bernhardt’s,
is distinct and clear, each syllable coming
out with well-rounded edges.” Though
Sarcey thought her, as Cleopatra, to have “the
air of a crowned grisette,” (in contrast to
Sarah, who was “always the Queen of Egypt”)
he confessed that “La Duse carried the house
by storm with her alternate explosions of fury
and sudden tones of touching tenderness.”
Sarcey’s early sympathy for Duse was, as we
shall see, to be of benefit to her later. During
this transalpine tour Duse acted in Russia and
Germany, as well as in Austria; and now was to
come her first venture in an English-speaking
country.</p>

<p>In 1893 Americans interested in the European
stage knew that Duse had achieved fame
in her own country and had succeeded notably
in Austria and Germany. The average American
theatregoer knew little of her. Even
those who had heard of her had little notion
that she really was an actress of the first rank,
fully worthy of comparison with Bernhardt and
Modjeska.</p>

<p>On an evening of January, 1893, when a large
and brilliant audience assembled at the Fifth
Avenue Theatre in New York to see her in
<i>Camille</i>, the prevailing atmosphere was therefore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
one of curiosity.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> Duse had not long to
wait before striking fire. One who was present
said: “Her power over an audience was
manifested in a very striking manner before she
had been on the stage five minutes. The actress
had scarcely made her appearance and given
her careless nod of recognition to De Varville
before everybody was in an attitude of strained
attention. Already the old and hackneyed
character had been revivified by the power of
genius. Signora Duse does not attempt to
make a Frenchwoman of Camille, but fills her
with the fire and passion of her own Italian
temperament. But both the fire and passion,
except at very rare intervals, are kept under
complete control. Their glow is apparent in
all the love scenes, and breaks into flame at one
or two critical moments, but it is by the suggestion
of force in reserve that she makes her
most striking effects. Only an artist of the
highest type could create so profound an impression
with so little apparent effort or forethought,
by some light and seemingly spontaneous
gesture, by a sudden change of facial expression,
or by some subtle inflection of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
voice. The chief beauties of her impersonation
are to be found in its lesser and, to the inexperienced
eye, insignificant details. All her
by-play, although it appears to be due only to
the impulse of the moment, is dearly the result
of the most deliberate design, and changes with
every variety of mood or condition which it is
meant to illustrate. The impetuous, audacious,
bored and querulous Camille of the first act becomes
quite another creature beneath the softening
influence of the love passages with Armand—such
love passages as have not been witnessed
in a New York theatre half a dozen times in this
generation—and is transformed into a type of
placid and contented womanhood in the country
home of Armand. She played the whole of this
act with perfect skill and profoundest pathos,
and in the scene of parting with her lover, she
suggested the heart-breaking under a smile,
with a simplicity so true and so poignant that
her own suppressed sob found many an echo in
the audience.”<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> In the many accounts of
Duse’s Camille there is constant reference to a
simple and telling interpolation that she made
in the scene in which Armand publicly denounces
her. Where other actresses have
sought to express Marguérite’s feelings only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
through facial expression and pantomime, Duse
spoke at intervals during his tirade her lover’s
name—“Armand!”—at first in simple incredulity,
then in fright, then in deeply hurt
pride, then in heart-breaking anguish<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a>. Sarcey,
however, severely condemned her for making
this emendation, which, he thought, ruined
the naturalness and effectiveness of the scene.</p>

<p>Duse had come unheralded, but her few weeks
in New York proved a genuine “sensation.”
She followed <i>Camille</i> with <i>Fédora</i>, in which she
again demonstrated her strange power of creating
a stirring dramatic effect by the simplest
and apparently the most unstudied means. As
Clotilde in <i>Fernande</i> she presented another
type: “The change wrought in her by the dispatch
that proved her lover’s perfidy was an
extraordinary illustration of suppressed emotion,
and the remorseless deliberation of her
manner while beguiling the faithless Andre into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
the net which she had spread for him was intensely
eloquent of a woman scorned. Not until
after the marriage had been accomplished
did she give vent to the rage which she had restrained
so long; but when the floodgates of
passion were once opened, the torrent of her
wrath and hate and scorn might almost be called
appalling. This one revelation of her power
would place her instantly in the front rank
of emotional actresses.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> Another jealous
woman was revealed in Santuzza in <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i>. Astonishing in this part was the
complete sinking of her own personality in that
of a peasant woman. By voice, walk, subtle
suggestions of gesture and pose, she achieved
a masterpiece in what the French call “getting
within the skin” of a character. When to the
other impersonations she added her Mirandolina
in <i>La Locandiera</i>, a part calling for a
charming archness and humor, and as sure a
touch in comedy as Santuzza in tragedy, her
wide range was astonishingly revealed.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
After visiting a few other American cities,
Duse’s company arrived in London, and opened
an engagement there in May (1893). She was
the first Italian since Salvini to claim London’s
serious attention. She was at least as unknown
there to “the general” as she had been
in New York, though of course there were many
who had either seen her on the continent or had
read glowing accounts of her. But there were
many, at first, to ask: “Who is she?” When
she made her presence felt, as she promptly
did, there arose a fine critical storm with her as
the center. Bernhardt was idolized in London,
appeared there in the same season, and naturally
comparison was rife. As a matter of fact,
comparison between Duse and Bernhardt, both
of whom were well within their prime in the
early nineties, was one of the favorite intellectual
amusements of the day, with both professional
and amateur critics. Duse succeeded in
London, however, as she had succeeded elsewhere.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p>Thus had she swung about the world, making
known her great gifts, and firmly establishing
a genuine, honestly won fame. Only Paris remained
to be conquered, and before she attempted
that formidable task, she visited America
again.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
Now, at last, came Duse’s invasion of Paris.
Why was it delayed so long? What were the
circumstances of her going? And how did she
fare there? The answers to these questions
form a curious chapter in her history, and
in that of a great sister artist. Duse’s few
weeks in Paris in the early summer of 1897
mark the climax of her career, and may well be
described in some detail.</p>

<p>It is an established tenet of Parisian faith
that nothing in the artistic world can really be
said to have won the stamp of authentic
achievement until it has been seen and approved
by Paris. With much justification, surely, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
French are likely to consider themselves final
arbiters, and they do not go out of their way
to discover merit in a foreigner who has not yet
shown his art in “the home of art.”</p>

<p>Paris had heard the echoes of Duse’s achievements,
then, with the comfortable feeling that
if she really amounted to anything she would
come to Paris and prove it. Until then Parisians
could wait. Duse was known to be the
best Italian actress, Dumas’ interest in her had
been evidenced years before, and her success
in the large European cities and in America and
England was by no means unknown. But the
occasional whisper that Duse was comparable
to Bernhardt herself brought only indulgent
smiles. The lady evidently avoided the test.</p>

<p>That she had avoided the test was true.
Duse had been really afraid to go to Paris.
Later, after she had won the day, she admitted
as much. A failure in Paris would be, she recognized,
a fatal blow to her prestige and ambitions.</p>

<p>When Dumas had urged her to try her fortunes
in the French capital, he assumed that
she would act in French. But Duse knew how
sensitive were French ears to the niceties of the
language, how dependent on purity and beauty
of speech was much of the drama to which they
were accustomed, and how, she would be placing
herself under a heavy handicap in acting in a
strange medium.</p>

<p>It was not, then, until in Austria, Russia,
England and the United States she had been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
warmly received while acting in her native
tongue, that the conquest of Paris began to
seem possible.</p>

<p>Enter now, Sarah Bernhardt. Mme. Sarah,
unlike most Parisians, had seen Duse and knew
her quality. She knew the truth of the growing
impression that Duse was really a worthy rival.
Therefore, if Duse was really coming to Paris,
Sarah wished to involve herself in the proceedings,
and protect her position. It was announced
that where others had failed to induce
Duse to come to Paris, Bernhardt had succeeded.
More, she had offered Duse the use
of her own theatre. Thus Duse was put at once
in the position of <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">protégée</i>, and the press resounded
with praises of Sarah’s magnanimity.</p>

<p>Duse chose <i>Magda</i> for her first appearance.
It was a part well suited to her, and in it she
had less to fear in comparison with Bernhardt,
who had never scored so heavily with it as with
her other rôles. Bernhardt forthwith called on
Duse, and the announcement at once followed
that the opening performance was to be changed
to <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i> (<i>Camille</i>). Whatever
the honesty of Bernhardt’s motives, she
had succeeded in inducing Duse to appear first
in a part that was one of Sarah’s own triumphs.
One can imagine the new security that Bernhardt felt.</p>

<p>The house was crowded with the most brilliant
audience that Paris could muster. Word
had gone forth that one was to appear who had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
been mentioned in the same breath with the
idolized Bernhardt. Rochefort was there, and
so was Halévy, and Got, the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">doyen</i> of the
<i>Française</i>, and a throng of the distinguished
men and women of the Paris of the day. For
the critics, Lemaître was there, and Catulle
Mendes, and, most important, Francisque Sarcey.
Sarah herself was there, holding court,
and serene and smiling in her rôle of protecting
friend.</p>

<p>The story of that first performance is soon
told. It was a disappointment. During the
first act Duse was almost painfully nervous; in
the second she showed flashes of power, and
won some mild enthusiasm; in the third she was
listened to only with patience; in the fourth
the audience took more pleasure in Ando, her
“leading man,” than in Duse herself; in the
fifth she played the death scene beautifully, but
it was too late. “If someone had triumphed it
was not Duse.”</p>

<p>Already Paris thought that it had taken
Duse’s measure, and now that the alleged comparison
with Bernhardt was disposed of settled
back to enjoy her, if possible, for her
own sake. <i>Magda</i> followed. The critics were
a little more impressed. Sarcey in particular—his
criticism always appeared after a few
days’ interval—poured balm on Duse’s feelings.
He began to see that all had not yet been told.
“Everyone,” he wrote, “was delighted to see
so much naturalness combined with such great
force of feeling.... I think I am beginning<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
to distinguish the characteristic traits of her
peculiar talent.”</p>

<p>After the first performance of <i>Magda</i>, Duse
had been suddenly taken ill. Immediately
after Sarcey’s encouraging article—whether
or not it was the cause,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a>—she recovered and
was ready for the lists again.</p>

<p>Bernhardt grew apprehensive. She proposed
a gala performance in aid of the fund
for a memorial to Dumas. She announced that
she would give the last two acts of <i>La Dame
aux Camélias</i>, and that Duse had been asked to
give the second and third acts of the same play.
Now the third act was the point where Duse
had most signally failed to please Paris on that
memorable first night. She was by now wary
of Bernhardt’s “friendship,” and said that
while she was eager to appear in honor of
Dumas, she would substitute the second act of
<i>La Femme de Claude</i>. And on this substitution
she insisted in spite of all Mme. Sarah
could say.</p>

<p>The audience had anticipated a rare feast of
acting and was not disappointed. It applauded
both actresses to the echo. But notice
how Sarah worked into this occasion an
element that had reference not so much to the
glorification of Dumas as to the glorification of
herself: “The curtain rises to disclose the
celebrated bust of Dumas, by Carpeaux, which
occupies the center of the stage. Grouped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
about, at a respectful distance, are all the artists
who have taken part in the performance,
while in advance of all, face to face with the
bust itself, stands Sarah Bernhardt. She still
wears the costume of Marguérite Gauthier, and
is there as the accepted symbol, the unrivaled
personification of Dumas’ immortal creation.
Duse is in the background along with the
others.</p>

<p>“A poem has been composed especially for
the occasion by Edmond Rostand, in which
Bernhardt is allowed to address Dumas in a
tone of familiar grandeur, as befits one genius
in the presence of another. After one expressive
pause, therefore, she changes her attitude
and begins.</p>

<p>“‘She recites these exquisite verses [the
account in the <i>Gaulois</i> said] with a charm of
tenderness, an intensity of feeling, that arouse
new transports of enthusiasm. The whole audience
is on its feet, quivering, with arms outstretched
toward the prodigious <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i>, who
makes an effort to bow, but is overcome by the
force of her emotion. The curtain rises and
falls an incalculable number of times, disclosing
the great <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tragédienne</i> in her gracious attitude
of homage to the great dramatist. And then,
with a movement of touching spontaneity, Sarah
goes to La Duse, seizes her hand, and both incline
before the bust of the master. The spectacle
is one that will never be forgotten.’”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
How very Gallic! And how extremely effective
as an apotheosis of Bernhardt! With
Duse triumphantly subordinated by means of
Bernhardt’s apparently magnanimous demonstrations
of friendship, and with the Paris season
practically at an end, Mme. Sarah left town
and repaired to England.</p>

<p>In spite of all, Duse went on. In rapid succession
she played <i>La Locandiera</i>, <i>Sogno di un
Mattino di Primavera</i> (a new play by d’Annunzio),
<i>La Femme de Claude</i>, and <i>Cavalleria
Rusticana</i>.</p>

<p>A curious thing happened. Her great first-night
audience Duse had not been able to overwhelm.
Now, by the slow-working influence of
her very genuine art, she gained a cumulative
hold on the imagination and affection of the
Paris public. An open letter to her, signed
“Sganarelle,” appeared in <i>Le Temps</i>, appealing
to her to give a final matinée especially for
her brother and sister artists to whom “her
methods had opened new horizons.” “Sganarelle”
proved to be Sarcey. His project was
taken up with an enthusiasm that told how effective,
after all, had been Duse’s unobtrusive
art. Lavrouniet, in <i>Figaro</i>, speaking of Bernhardt
and Duse, in a few sentences admirably
characterized the art of both. The former, he
says, “from a constant desire to be unique,
supplies all the highest and rarest expressions
of art, except one—simplicity. In La Duse, we
have seen on the stage a woman’s nature and
that of an <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i> completing each other—the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i> playing with all the sensitiveness of a
woman, and the woman allowing herself to be
entirely absorbed in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i>.” Lemaître
also wrote sympathetically: “She came to us,
preceded by a European reputation a rival sister
of the great Sarah. We were not deceived,
for Duse is a dramatic <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i>, original to the
core, and of the first rank. We were told she
was beyond everything an astonishing realist;
that she lived her parts rather than played
them, and in this way took her audience by
storm. And that statement is doubtless exact....
What seems to me incontestably Mme.
Duse’s is her singular charm and grace, her
sweetness and tenderness. On that account
her search for the truth, her solicitude to avoid
the exhibition of any artifice, her realism, so
very minute and so very sincere, reach even to
poetry. Hers is the unique charm of a matured
woman,—impassioned, bruised, suffering,
nervous,—in whom, however, survives a young
and ingenuous grace, almost that of a young
girl, of a strange young girl.”</p>

<p>Duse promptly and gladly accepted the invitation
to give the special matinée. Her lease
of Bernhardt’s theatre had expired and it was
necessary to write to England to ask the use
of the house. Bernhardt tendered it gratuitously,
but, wishing still to have a share in all
that was going on, requested that the invitations
bear her name and Duse’s side by side.
Duse saw difficulties. “I could not invite my
companions in France to come and admire me.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
That would be too presumptuous.” When
Sarah could not have her way, she suggested
that the performance be abandoned. Instead,
the <i>Porte St. Martin</i> was secured. The newspapers
got wind of the negotiations that Duse’s
manager and Bernhardt had been carrying on
by telegraph, and when the latter’s motives
became apparent, there was another reaction
in favor of Duse. There was room in the <i>Porte
St. Martin</i> for only one-tenth of the applicants
for seats, and, when the day arrived, the audience
seemed to Sarcey “like a violin whose
strings are tightened and ready to vibrate under
the bow.” “It was the first time,” he
wrote, “I have seen an audience thus formed
and in such a frame of mind. There was no
artificial commotion; it was expectation, full of
security and joy.” Of what followed Jules
Huret wrote in <i>Figaro</i>: “I am afraid of my
incompetence to describe the powerful, the profound
emotion of those three hours, where an
entire audience composed of the flower of
French comedians, of well-known writers, great
painters and celebrated sculptors, honored a
foreign <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i> with the most vibrating, the
most enthusiastic, the most poignant manifestation
that it is possible to witness.”</p>

<p>Duse played for them <i>Cavalleria Rusticana</i>,
the last act of <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>, and the
second act of <i>La Femme de Claude</i>. Never
had she acted better. When the curtain fell
“the whole audience rose to its feet, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">bravas</i> and
<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">vivats</i> thundered through the house, handkerchiefs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
and hats were waving, flowers flew from
boxes,—‘<i>Au revoir! Au revoir! Au revoir!</i>’—and
ten times the curtain had to be raised
before the smiling actress, who did not attempt
to conceal her joy. Then the stage was immediately
invaded by the crowd. Some wished
only to see her once again; some must embrace
her; others asked for a flower from the bunch
she held in her hand. During one whole hour
the procession did not cease. I saw there
young actresses and rising actors, with tears in
their eyes, not daring to approach her. Coquelin
wishes to act with her just once and
begs her to play in French.... Mme. Laurent
comes also, and slowly, with sober words, expresses
her admiration. The Ambassador of
Italy and his wife arrive in their turn, and congratulate
her with happy faces. And her
troupe, who leave to-day for Italy, wait to say
good-by.... She kisses them, much moved.”
Next day Duse was fêted by the <i>Comédie Française</i>.
What a change was this in a few short
weeks! The ending was a fine outburst, of a
sort possible only to the Latin races, and it
marked the very zenith of Duse’s career.</p>

<p>Such was Duse’s progress from a poverty-stricken,
obscure childhood to a place, at the
age of thirty-eight, equal, to say the least, that
of any actress of her day.</p>

<p>Duse could not fail to find deep satisfaction
in her progress from triumph to triumph. But
in her case one feels that biographical detail,
the accidents of place and date, matter comparatively<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
little. She was a curiously detached
spirit. “If I had my will,” she once
told Arthur Symons, “I would live in a ship in
the sea, and never come nearer to humanity
than that.” As it was, she lived only in the
realm of her art. She was of infinite natural
dignity, a shy, proud woman, always far removed
from the petty publicities of theatrical
life, like some patrician living her isolated life
on a country estate. An utter simplicity and
sincerity, the fruits of a fine nature and of “the
slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,” attended
her always.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Her face, pale and typically<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
Italian, at once sad and ardent, is the
face of a woman who has thoroughly lived, but
whose soul is equal to great trials. Her health
was never robust,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> and bodily weakness has
often interrupted her work. Her voice was
sad, her habit silence, though on rare occasions
she is said to talk merrily. Although Duse as
an actress and as a woman gives the impression
of an all-pervading sadness, of a profound
thoughtfulness, “the thoughtfulness of one who
comes toward us from a sanctuary of brooding
on life’s eternal questions,” the more amiable
and human traits are not wholly lacking in her.
She is said to be quick to grasp a joke and to
be fond of humorous books. She is extravagant
in her delight in flowers. At her country
place in Tuscany she has literally thousands of
rose bushes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
Of only medium height, she somehow on the
stage suggested tallness. Her hair was once
of typical Italian jet-blackness, but long ago
it turned quite white, and she was forced on
the stage to wear wigs; off the stage, she is
said to have taken pride in her white hair. For
many years she appeared on the stage without
“make-up” of any kind, but after about 1900
she found it necessary as a means to the
appearance of youth. Among the Italians she
was known as “<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">dalle belle mani</i>,” for her
hands were, perhaps, her chief beauty, small
and beautifully wrought; and like the Italian
she was, she used them expressively and gracefully.
Her reticent nature showed itself in her
personal tastes. Off stage and on she dressed
with great simplicity, and she disliked jewelry.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>She became a great reader, and though she
never acquired English, Shakespeare was one
of her enthusiasms. Maeterlinck was another.
Cryptic sciences fascinated her. In modern
art, her sympathies were with the symbolists
and impressionists. It was not strange that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
d’Annunzio, the poet-dramatist-novelist who
was making his presence felt in Italy about the
time of her Paris triumph, should appeal to her
as a kindred spirit. His fiery exaltation of
human passions, his undoubted poetic gifts, she
took for real genius, and about 1900 the world
heard that Duse had forsworn all dramatists
else and would act henceforth nothing but
d’Annunzio’s plays. The poet and the actress
formed an association that was plainly more
than that of friendship or professional coöperation.
That she was passionately devoted to
d’Annunzio for some years, and that their
friendship was broken by the publication of one
of his novels—in which he made literary use
of what she considered their sacred alliance—was
the talk of Europe. The resulting separation
she is said to have taken, as she had her
earlier love affair, with tragic seriousness.
How much her retirement from the stage was
due to this disappointment, and how much
merely to advancing age, it is difficult to say.</p>

<p>The d’Annunzio campaign was not a success,
even in Italy. His plays were not saved by
patriotic interest in the author or by affection
for the actress from being thought decadent
and undramatic, though everywhere the richness
of their poetic strain was recognized.
Duse’s faith however, until the rupture with
d’Annunzio, was unreasoning and unswerving.
She came to the United States again in 1902,
acting in his plays.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> She did nothing with them<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
to add to the fame she had earlier acquired,
though, in spite of d’Annunzio, her acting still
retained its freedom from artificiality or exaggeration.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<p>After her return to Europe her appearances
became more infrequent. In 1904 she gave a
“command performance” at the English
court (she had always been popular in England,
which received comparatively well even
the d’Annunzio plays), and in 1906 she came
all the way from Italy to assist in the great
testimonial to Ellen Terry. Illness, which assailed
her often, and weariness of her work,
herself and all things else, kept her from the
stage most of the time. She continued, however,
to keep her company constantly under salary
and at her command, and as late as 1909
it was her custom, when at rare intervals the
spirit moved her, to assemble them for brief
appearances in the European capitals. Of late
years she has given her energy to the founding
of a home for aged actors.</p>

<p>By means first of vivid imagining and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
by the revealing power of an unobtrusive, lucid
art Duse made herself the greatest <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">artiste</i> of
her day. When the French said she had widened the
horizon of her art they paid tribute
to what was, after all, something akin to original
genius.</p>

<p>“The furthest extremes of Duse’s range as
an artist,” wrote Bernard Shaw, who is only
one of the critics to give her the foremost place
among modern actresses, “must always remain
a secret between herself and a few fine observers.
I should say without qualification that
it is the best modern acting I have ever seen....
Duse is the first actress whom we have seen
applying the method of the great school to characteristically
modern parts or to characteristically
modern conceptions of old parts....
In Duse you necessarily get the great school in
its perfect integrity, because Duse without her
genius would be a plain little woman of no use
to any manager.... Duse, <em>with</em> her genius, is
so fascinating that it is positively difficult to
attend to the play, instead of attending wholly
to her.... Sarah Bernhardt has nothing but
her own charm.... Duse’s own private charm
has not yet been given to the public. She gives
you Césarine’s charm, Marguérite Gauthier’s
charm, the charm of La Locandiera, the charm,
in short, belonging to the character she impersonates;
and you are enthralled by its reality
and delighted by the magical skill of the artist
without for a moment feeling any complicity
either on your own part or on hers in the passion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
represented.” Shaw did not hesitate to
enter into the once popular game of comparing
Bernhardt and Duse, and in his estimate
Madame Sarah is indeed a bad second. “The
French artist’s stock of attitudes and facial effects
could be catalogued as easily as her stock
of dramatic ideas: the counting would hardly go
beyond the fingers of both hands. Duse produces
the illusion of being infinite in variety of
beautiful pose and motion. Every idea, every
shade of thought and mood, expresses itself delicately
but vividly to the eye.... When it is
remembered that the majority of tragic actors
excel only in explosions of those passions which
are common to man and brute, there will be no
difficulty in understanding the indescribable distinction
which Duse’s acting acquires from the
fact that behind every stroke of it is a distinctively
human idea.”</p>

<p>Duse even in her early career, when she was
but little more than twenty, had already broken
with dramatic traditions.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> There was a fairly
definite Italian tradition which had been made
familiar by Ristori and which had been fostered
by Salvini. If Duse had been French instead
of Italian and if she had undergone the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
regular training of the <i>Conservatoire</i>, she would
have met with another tradition, of which at
the time Bernhardt was becoming an efficient
missionary, imposing its standards even outside
of France. Duse in some way escaped all
traditions. Her training, such as it was, had
been with strolling players and in provincial
theatres. What this experience did succeed in
giving her was the habit of dramatic expression,
a habit that, by the time she had arrived
at the age when the usual stage-struck girl becomes
an actress, had made her mistress of
self-expression, free from self-consciousness.
Added to this habit of going directly to the expression
of an idea or emotion there was, in
Duse’s case, besides the sheer womanliness
that shone through all her work, the ardent,
sympathetic imagination that enabled her to
project herself into another personality, sharing
its emotions and divining its experiences
and actions. When these emotions and these
actions reached the stage of expression there
was no rigid, school-taught method to hamper
her. An ingrained habit of expression, coupled
with an illuminating, self-effacing imagination,
formed the secret of Duse’s famed
“naturalness.” Most actresses interpret or
“portray” a character; Duse became the character
itself, transmuted into life in terms of
Duse’s own mind and spirit, and, as often as
not something finer, more noble, more sensitive,
than the dramatist’s conception. Such a character,
with her, was “a figure designed and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
modeled beforehand, proportioned, poised, and
polished to the finger tips with a sculptor’s patient
assiduity, and then, by an ever renewed
miracle endowed with ‘the crowded hour of
glorious life’ at the electric touch of the artist’s
imagination.”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<h2 id="ADA_REHAN">ADA REHAN</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As</span> a superbly alive, radiant personality, Ada
Rehan stands out in the memory of any one
who has ever seen her. She is of the great line
of actresses. She is (or one should say <em>was</em>, for
Ada Rehan several years ago passed from the
stage) more nearly a Woffington, a Terry, than
any actress America has yet produced. Like
Ellen Terry, she was a miraculous blend of
regal force, charm, and thoroughly grounded
ability.</p>

<div id="ip_203" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 27em;">
  <img src="images/i_227.jpg" width="432" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">ADA REHAN</div></div>

<p>Yet “miraculous” is hardly the word, for
Ada Rehan labored long and devotedly for the
eminence that both America and England accorded
her. Hers was no sudden Mary-Anderson-like
leap into “stardom,” nor did she gain
a prominent place on the stage with the comparative
ease that seems possible in these days.
As we shall see, her apprenticeship was exceedingly
long and arduous. In proportion was her
radiance, when once she was placed in the map
of “stars,” for Rehan will be at least a tradition,
to be placed with those of Woffington and
Terry, when her lesser sisters are long since
quite forgotten. She was the supreme embodiment
for all time, one feels certain, of Katherine,
Shakespeare’s Shrew. That part she was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
born to play. Her Beatrice, her Rosalind, her
Viola were all memorable impersonations; and
she played the heroines of old English comedy
in a way that again recalled the famous actresses
of the past.</p>

<p>Ada Rehan<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> was born in Limerick, Ireland.
The fact is rich in significance, for though she
was brought to the United States while she was
a mere child, and received here all of her stage
training, there is no denying the strong Celtic
strain in her, the Irish buoyancy and geniality.</p>

<p>The family came to America in 1865,<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
Ada was about ten, and settled in Brooklyn.
None of her family had ever been on the stage,
and she went to school, as any other girl would,
quite as if she were never destined to be an actress.
The three Crehan sisters must have
been a talented, attractive group of girls, however,
for both of Ada’s elder sisters preceded
her to the stage, though neither of them gained
a tithe of the repute that was to come to the
youngest of the three.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> When Ada first stepped
on a stage, Kate, the eldest, had been on the
stage half-a-dozen years, and for four years had
been the wife of Oliver Doud Byron, the author
and star of <i>Across the Continent</i>, a great popular
success of the day.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> One night, when the
Byrons were playing <i>Across the Continent</i>, in
Newark, New Jersey, the actress who played
Clara, a small part, was suddenly taken ill.
Ada, who up to now had had no idea, no definite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
idea at least, of attempting a stage career, was
pressed into service, and played the part that
one night, and played it with such confidence and
success that a family council straightway determined
her fate for her. She was to go on
the stage.</p>

<p>This date, 1873, is the first one of great importance
in Miss Rehan’s stage career. The
next came six years later when Augustin Daly
engaged her as a member of his company at
Daly’s Theatre. Theatre, company, manager
and “leading woman” there combined to write
one of the most brilliant chapters in America’s
theatrical history.</p>

<p>The record of those six early years after her
first appearance, and before she went to Daly,
is one of the most amazing industry and progress.
She played for a time with the Byrons,
and made while with them her first appearance
in New York (1873) in a small part in <i>The
Thoroughbred</i>. Soon she went to Philadelphia
for her first regular engagement, as a member
of Mrs. John Drew’s company at the Arch
Street Theatre. John Drew, the younger, the
present actor of that name, made his first appearance
at about the same time, also in Mrs.
Drew’s company. Here Miss Rehan remained
for two seasons (1873–75) receiving much valuable
training, though as yet she played only
subordinate parts.</p>

<p>Then came several seasons of “stock”—“stock”
according to the old-fashioned system,
in which the “stars” wandered from city to city,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
finding in each place a company ready to support
them in the standard plays and ready to
“get up” in new plays at short notice. As
many of the “stars” acted in the same plays,
the stock company was less like the present day
organization so called, which presents a new
play each week and then drops it for good, than
like a “repertoire company,” with a number of
plays always thoroughly at its command. The
system made for thorough training, as it combined
with a wide range of material opportunities
for many performances of any given play.
The later Daly company, often called a stock
company, was really such a repertoire company
save that it boasted its own fixed and brilliant
“star,” Ada Rehan.</p>

<p>After her two years with Mrs. John Drew,
Miss Rehan went to Louisville to join the stock
company of Macauley’s Theatre, where she remained
one season (1875–6). If she had remained
a few months longer she would have assisted
in the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">début</i> there of Mary Anderson.</p>

<p>She followed her year in Louisville with two
seasons (1876–8) as a member of John W. Albaugh’s
company in Albany.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> Here it was, in
December, 1877, while she was playing Bianca
in <i>Katherine and Petruchio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> that Augustin
Daly first saw her and observed her exceptional
talent.</p>

<p>At the end of her service with Mr. Albaugh
she was but twenty-three. And yet she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
been a regularly engaged professional actress
for five years, had played Ophelia to Booth’s
Hamlet and Lady Anne to John McCullough’s
Richard III, besides acting at various times
Cordelia in <i>Lear</i>, Desdemona in <i>Othello</i>, Celia
in <i>As You Like It</i>, and Olivia in <i>Twelfth
Night</i>, and had appeared not only with Booth
and McCullough but with Adelaide Neilson,
Lawrence Barrett, John Brougham, John T.
Raymond, and many of the other “stars” of
the day.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<p>Next, during the season of 1878–79, Miss
Rehan was for a brief period in the company
of Fanny Davenport. In the course of this engagement
a now forgotten play, <i>Pique</i>, was
acted by Miss Davenport, and Ada Rehan was
given the part of Mary Standish. The author
of the play was Augustin Daly. When it was
given at the Grand Opera House in New York,
in April, 1879, Mr. Daly again was struck by
the promise of the young actress whom he had
seen as Bianca in Albany a year and a half
before. Immediately he placed her under his
management and gave her the part of Big<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Clémence in his own version of Zola’s <i>L’Assommoir</i>,
which he produced at the Olympic Theatre
the following month. It was a small part, she
did it well, and within a few weeks was promoted
to the part of Virginie. In September
of the same year she appeared for the first time
on the stage of Daly’s Theatre, which was built,
oddly enough, on the site of Wood’s Museum,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a>
where six years ago she had acted her small part
in <i>The Thoroughbred</i>. It is worth mentioning
that the first parts—both in September, 1879—in
the long list, literally of hundreds, that she
was to act during her twenty years with Mr.
Daly were Nelly Beers in <i>Love’s Young Dream</i>,
and Lu Ten Eyck in <i>Divorce</i>.</p>

<p>With Ada Rehan the leading woman of the
reorganized Daly company there began a new
era in her career, in Mr. Daly’s, and, it is fair
to say, in American acting. Until Mr. Daly’s
death in 1899 Miss Rehan retained her position,
and in that time she progressed from obscurity
to the position of one of the leading actresses
of her day, famous alike in America and England,
and famous even on the continent of
Europe. With Mr. Daly’s death, though she
continued to act and to act well, there passed
the period of her peculiar fame, and in a half-dozen
years she had ceased to act altogether.</p>

<p>Such, in bald and brief outline, has been
Rehan’s career. Of the struggles, the aspirations,
the triumphs of an actress, of her life,
in short, any mere record can tell but little.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
What sort of woman was Ada Rehan? Well,
she was of the royal line of women, regal in her
stature, opulent in bodily beauty, gracious and
rich in her nature. Her face, like her careless
joyousness and exuberant animal spirits, was
Celtic. She was not beautiful in the conventional
sense, but as with Ellen Terry, simple
beauty paled beside her. Her hair was exuberant
too, and brown, except where, in the middle
of her career, it became streaked with gray.
She had the gray-blue Irish eye. “What a
great woman she was!” wrote one of her more
rhapsodic admirers.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> “Tall, easy, almost majestic,
except that the geniality of her manner
took from majesty its aloofness and pride.
When she spoke her voice came out mellifluently,
so that without forcing it seemed to
pervade the room. It had something of the
quality of a blackbird’s note. Ada Rehan is
not at all of a classic type of countenance. She
is genuine Celtic. To call her pretty would be
ridiculous, for prettiness is something that
seems to dwindle beside her. To call her beautiful
would be neither completely expressive nor
apt, for her features have the warp of too many
conflicting, irrepressible emotions, and the turn
of what one feels tempted to call <em>rale ould Irish
humor</em>. Yet the eyes, and the brow, and the
head are beautiful—the eyes especially, with
their soft, lamp-like, mellow glow, with their
sharp, fiery glints, with their gorgon directness,
or again with their innumerable little twinkles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
of fun and sly melting shadows, with the flashing
from the lids and the eyelashes of light, or
the deep, still beaming that perhaps most eloquently
of all speaks of soul.” These are high
words, indeed, but they had much provocation.</p>

<p>All these things, and more, Rehan appeared
across the footlights. Off the stage, simply as
Ada Rehan, she was still the exceptional woman.
An actress who is capable of diverse and subtle
characterizations is often, singularly enough, in
her own person a woman of essential simplicity.
Such seems to have been the case with Ada
Rehan. Her lack of pose can be glimpsed in
various ways, in her capacity for pleasure in
the success of others, her ability to see and
admire beauty and talent in other women,—a
severe test for any actress. “She was generous
and grateful, and she never forgot a kindness,”
says Mr. Winter. “Her mind was free from
envy and bitterness ... and she never spoke
an ill word of anybody.” One more evidence
of her simplicity was her un-Bernhardtian sense
of contentment in the limited opportunities for
personal glorification afforded by her position
with Mr. Daly. As we shall see, she refused
numbers of offers to star, preferring the comparative
obscurity of her position as “Daly’s
leading woman.” Notice the phrases of a
writer in the <i>Sun</i>, who observed her on the
street in New York in 1894, after her return
from triumphant appearances in London. “She
exhibits a degree of calm serenity that might almost
be called matronly.... Her face wears a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
youthful and almost childish expression....
Much of her time has been spent since her return
in looking in the shop windows, but apparently
she has not purchased much, either here or in
Europe, as her attire is invariably that of a
woman who devotes little thought to dress!”
But this writer goes on to say: “No one would
be likely to mistake her for anything but an
actress nowadays. Her distinction of bearing
is so great that, even if her face were not familiar
to the public, a great many people would
turn around to look at her a second time as she
walks along the street.”</p>

<p>Her early education was inconsiderable, and
we are told that even during her brief career
in school she cared less for her lessons than for
romping with her three brothers,—a course that
may not have been without its value in preparing
her for her success as Katherine and Peggy
Thrift. Later, however, she read much. She
liked Thackeray, and she particularly admired
Balzac. “Her knowledge of human nature,—gained
partly by keen intuition and partly by
close observance,—was ample, various, and
sound,” wrote William Winter, who knew her
well. “Her thoughts, and often her talk, dwelt
upon traits of character, fabrics of art, and
beauties of nature, and she loved rather to speak
of these than of the commonplaces and practical
affairs of the passing day. Her grasp of
character was intuitive; she judged rightly, and
she was seldom or never mistaken in her estimate
of individuals. Her perception was exceedingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
acute, and she noted, instantly and
correctly, every essential trait, however slight,
of each person who approached her presence.
She was intrinsically sincere, modest, and
humble—neither setting a great value on herself
nor esteeming her powers and achievements
to be unusual; she has been known to be in
tears, at what she deemed a professional failure,
while a brilliant throng of friends was waiting
to congratulate her on an unequivocal success.”</p>

<p>Here, as elsewhere, Mr. Winter has poured
out his praise with a lavish hand. Yet it is clear
that Ada Rehan added many fine qualities, for
those who knew her, to those qualities known
to all who saw her: vitality, a true sense of
comedy, personal charm.</p>

<p>For a long time newspaper interviewers had
the greatest difficulty in getting Miss Rehan to
talk for them. Like Duse and Mrs. Fiske, she
loathed the interview. By nature she was,
within the circle of her friends, candid and ingenuous,
talking freely, stating frankly her
opinions and drawing freely from a fund of interesting
anecdotes about the personages she
met and knew on both sides of the ocean. It is
related that during her first visit to London,
she met at a dinner an editor with whom
she talked in her characteristic manner. He
printed all she said. Though she was of a
kindly disposition and had said nothing uncomfortable,
she was annoyed by the incident,
and for years avoided journalists.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
Daly’s Theatre, in the days when Ada Rehan
was at the height of her charm and power, was
sometimes called “the <i>Théâtre Français</i> of
America.” The leading man was John Drew
(who did not become an independent “star” until
1892); the comedian was James Lewis, a
talented, intelligent, genuinely comic actor;<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a>
the “dowager parts” were played by the incomparable
Mrs. James Gilbert; and the
younger women of the company were Isabel
Irving and Kitty Cheatham, both clever actresses,
though they paled beside Rehan. At
Daly’s one saw acting that dispelled any impression
of theatricalism. Mr. Daly’s rule was
rigorous, his standards exacting.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> He was altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
an exceptional manager, scholarly and
thorough; and his instructions and advice were
of immense benefit to the actors in his company,—a
fact that Ada Rehan always freely acknowledged.</p>

<p>The list of parts that Miss Rehan in the
twenty years between 1879 and 1899 acted in
Mr. Daly’s company is simply amazing in its
extent and range. We think of her as Katherine,
as Viola, Rosalind or Beatrice, but she had
been with Mr. Daly several years before the
company attempted Shakespeare. Before,
there had been a long succession of plays whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
names mean nothing to us nowadays. Many of
them were adaptations, made by the versatile
Mr. Daly himself, from the German. Adaptations
from the French, the American, and English
stage had seen in plenty; but the German
comedies afforded Mr. Daly a comparatively
unworked field of which he made the most.
One gets a satisfying sense of the essential improvement
since 1890 in the art of playwriting
in America upon reflecting that these translations
and rearrangements of pieces grown on a
foreign soil would seem, if presented in our
theatres today, peculiarly thin and artificial.
Miss Rehan’s more discerning admirers regretted
the waste of her great talent in them,
but then, as now, the theatre had to be made a
paying institution in order to exist at all, and
these plays indubitably succeeded. The finished
acting of the Daly company, admirable
both in individual impersonation and in <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">ensemble</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
made them one of the keenest of the
theatrical pleasures of the day.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<p>Miss Rehan did not at once leap into recognition
as the leading American actress of the day.
For a long time she was thought of merely as
a prominent member of an excellent organization.
Gradually, however, by sheer merit, her
preëminence became evident. With confidence
she undertook all kinds of rôles, and, in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
midst of her work, there would occasionally
flash forth an impersonation that would seem,
what it often was, acting of unique quality.</p>

<p>Rehan was essentially a queen of comedy.
Though she attempted from time to time impersonations
of a grave and even of a tragic nature,
and by virtue of sincerity and womanliness gave
them much appeal, she never would have gained
her preëminent position by such means. Her
range was as wide, however, as the true meaning
of the word “comedy,” and extended from
the graceful performance of the mirthful or
sentimental foolery of Daly’s adaptations,
through the satire of <i>The Critic</i> to the farcical
comedy of <i>The Shrew</i>, the tenderly romantic
comedy of <i>As You Like It</i> and <i>Twelfth Night</i>,
and the sophisticated “high comedy” of <i>Much
Ado</i>.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
It is difficult for one who has seen her in the
part to think of Shakespeare’s Katherine, in
<i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, without at once
thinking of Ada Rehan. The pride, the majesty,
the complete identification with the varying
moods of the character, and the humanity
she gave to what can easily be made merely a
stage figure, were quite irresistible. Perhaps
she succeeded so well in this part because it was
in many ways a reflection of her own personality.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a></p>

<p>Her Rosalind, by all accounts, was probably
the best, possibly excepting Adelaide Neilson’s,
that the American stage has seen; her Viola
“manifested a poetic actress of the first order.”
Add to these her Beatrice, her Mrs. Ford, her
Helena, her Portia, not to speak of the half
dozen heroines of Shakespeare she played before
she joined Daly’s company, and you have
a well rounded accomplishment as a Shakespearean
actress, which, if she had done nothing
else, would have won her fame.</p>

<p>And she did much else. One of Mr. Daly’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
noteworthy departures from the ordinary
theatrical routine was his revival of various
specimens of old English comedy: <i>The Country
Wife</i> (in Garrick’s version called <i>The Country
Girl</i>), <i>The Inconstant</i>, <i>She Would and She
Would Not</i>, <i>The Recruiting Officer</i> were all
Restoration comedies, modified by Mr. Daly to
suit modern taste; and <i>The Critic</i> was his one-act
rearrangement of Sheridan’s famous three-act
satire of that name. These pieces all involved
difficult tasks for a modern actress, for
their language is of another time, their feelings
of a different civilization. The plays are never
professionally revived nowadays; and Mr.
Daly’s ventures with them succeeded mainly
through the conspicuous ability of Miss Rehan
to give her characters, whatever their dress or
speech, naturalness and vitality.</p>

<p>There was some surprise when Mr. Daly produced
Coppée’s <i>The Prayer</i>, for the usually
buoyant Rehan had now to portray a thoroughly
serious character. Yet, says Mr. Winter:<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
“No one acquainted with her nature was surprised
at the elemental passion, the pathos, and
the almost tragic power with which she expressed
a devoted woman’s experience of affliction,
misery, fierce resentment, self-conquest,
self-abnegation, forgiveness and fortitude.
She did not then, nor at any time, show herself
to be a tragic actress, but she evinced great
force and deep feeling.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
It further strengthens one’s impression of
Miss Rehan’s really triumphant versatility to
read the records of her Lady Teazle, which
subtly suggested the country girl within the
fine lady; of her Letitia Hardy with “its intrinsic
loftiness of woman’s spirit”; of her
Jenny O’Jones, an irresistibly comic figure done
in the spirit of frank farce; or of any of her
half hundred impersonations in modern comedy,
on which she lavished the spirit, the beauty, the
technical proficiency that were always in evidence,
whether or not the material she worked
with was wholly deserving of her gifts. She
was always ambitious, always a patient hard
worker, and she never slighted her tasks.</p>

<p>In 1884, when Miss Rehan and the reorganized
Daly company had been working together
for five years, they made their first visit to
London, where they played a six weeks’ summer
season at Toole’s Theatre. London did
not take kindly either to Mr. Daly’s pieces from
the German, which then formed their repertoire,
or to Miss Rehan herself, whose style of acting
was a surprise to conservative eyes. William
Archer wrote in <i>The World</i>: “The style of
Miss Ada Rehan is too crude and bouncing to
be entirely satisfactory to an English audience.
She makes Flos a painfully ill-bred young person,—surely
not a fair type of the American
girl; and her way of emphasizing her remarks
by making eyes over the footlights is certainly
not good comedy.”<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> Clement Scott, on the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
other hand, praised her. No great impression
was made, on the whole, but two years later,
(1886) when Mr. Daly again took his company
to London, Miss Rehan really made a name for
herself, although the plays were as yet what
seem to us now paltry pieces for such an actress:
<i>A Night off</i>, and <i>Nancy and Company</i>.
At this time Mr. Daly offered his company in
the English provincial cities and even ventured
to present them in Hamburg, Berlin and Paris,
where they met some success.</p>

<p>Mr. Daly continued his biennial visit to London.
In 1888, after the failure there of <i>The
Railroad of Love</i>,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> he offered London its first
glimpse of Rehan’s Katherine the Shrew. The
immediate result was a grand chorus of critical
praise, and a remarkable exhibition of public
interest. If on her first entrance “she ‘took the
stage’ in a manner that astonished even the oldest
playgoer,” and if, as one paper said,
“Katherines had been seen before, but never
such a Katherine as this,” it is true that the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
actress herself also “took the stage” in popular
fancy. Rehan at home was something of a
recluse, but now in London she allowed “society”
to pay her its tribute in its own way.
She was fêted, and dined, and given a public
reception. Different this from her habits in
New York, where reading, and walks with her
dogs, made up the sum of her leisurely activity.
During the 1888 tour Miss Rehan played
Katherine at Stratford-on-Avon (where her
portrait in that rôle was hung in the Shakespeare
Memorial Theatre), and in Paris, where
Victorien Sardou assisted in her “great
triumph.”</p>

<p>After another two years, in June, 1890, the
company again appeared in London, and this
time, in the estimation of the critics, her Rosalind—“a
Rosalind who is a very woman, and
never an actress!”—surpassed even her Katherine.</p>

<p>From now on the trips to London became
more frequent and it soon became part of Mr.
Daly’s programme to complete each season
with a few months in the English capital. He
built there his own theatre, and it was Ada
Rehan who laid its corner-stone.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> She visited
Tennyson, who read to her his play <i>The Foresters</i>,
which Daly later produced with Miss
Rehan as Marian Lea.</p>

<p>In June, 1893, the new Daly’s Theatre was
completed, and the company deserted America
for more than a year to go to London to establish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
the success of the new house. It was
dedicated by Miss Rehan’s performance of the
Shrew on June 27. <i>The Foresters</i>, <i>The School
for Scandal</i> and <i>The Country Girl</i> followed,
and then in January, 1894, she acted for London
her Viola, which was new to her repertoire.
Again a triumph, for <i>Twelfth Night</i> ran for
one hundred and eleven performances. And
again Miss Rehan consented, as still she had
never done in Now York, to indulge in the life
of society.</p>

<p>It was when she returned this time—after
spending the summer of 1894 wandering about
the Continent—that Miss Rehan became, for
the first time, a “star” in her own right. Miss
Rehan’s loyalty to the Daly company—or at
least her steadfastness in refusing to be weaned
away from it—was rather remarkable. When
the opportunity was offered her to appear as a
“star” and not merely as a member, drawing
a fixed salary, of Mr. Daly’s company, she at
first refused. Finally she consented to a brief
tour, to supplement her usual work with Mr.
Daly. Again, while she was abroad she had
received an offer from Possart to appear with
him at his theatre in Munich, another from
Blumenthal, a third from Sarah Bernhardt, and
still another from a syndicate in London to
manage and head a company there. In New
York, one of Mr. Daly’s rival managers offered
her “backing” as a “star” to the extent of
$50,000. Miss Rehan refused all these offers,
and remained content as leading woman of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
Daly stock company. Even now the independent
tour was limited to ten weeks; then she returned
to New York and her usual duties.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>In 1897 Mr. Daly sent Miss Rehan and his
company on another English tour. Beginning
(on August 26) with a performance of <i>As You
Like It</i>, at Stratford-on-Avon, on the sward of
the Shakespeare Memorial (of which Miss
Rehan was made one of the life governors) they
proceeded to the larger provincial cities, as far
as Glasgow and Edinburgh, playing <i>The Taming
of the Shrew</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Twelfth
Night</i>, <i>The School for Scandal</i>, and <i>The Last
Word</i>. The results of the tour were all Mr.
Daly could have hoped. Miss Rehan, as
Katherine, in particular, swept all before her.</p>

<p>It was during this English visit that George
Bernard Shaw, then dramatic critic of the
<i>Saturday Review</i>, wrote that he never saw Miss
Rehan act without burning to present Mr. Augustin
Daly with a delightful villa in St. Helena.
He thought Mr. Daly was wasting Miss Rehan’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
rare talent, just as that other rare talent, Miss
Terry’s, was wasted by her enmeshment at the
Lyceum. “Mr. Daly was in his prime an advanced
man relatively to his own time and
place,” wrote Mr. Shaw. “His Irish-American
Yanko-German comedies, as played by Ada
Rehan and Mrs. Gilbert, John Drew, Otis Skinner
and the late James Lewis, turned a page
in theatrical history here, and secured him a
position in London that was never questioned
until it became apparent that he was throwing
away Miss Rehan’s genius. When, after the
complete discovery of her gifts by the London
public, Mr. Daly could find no better employment
for her than in a revival of <i>Dollars
and Cents</i>, his annihilation and Miss Rehan’s
rescue became the critic’s first duty.” Mr.
Shaw’s predilection for the psychological, realistic
modern play led to his irritation with Miss
Rehan’s labors, as with Miss Terry’s, and even
to some doubt as to whether she was a creative
artist or a mere virtuosa. “In Shakespeare
she was and is irresistible.... But how about
Magda?” Yet, with unwonted complaisance,
Mr. Shaw also says, “I have never complained;
the drama with all its heroines levelled up to
a universal Ada Rehan has seemed no such
dreary prospect to me; and her voice compared
to Sarah Bernhardt’s <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">voix d’or</i>, has been as all
the sounds of the woodland to the clinking of
twenty-franc pieces.” And again, “Her treatment
of Shakespearean verse is delightful after
the mechanical intoning of Sarah Bernhardt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
She gives us beauty of tone, grace of measure,
delicacy of articulation: in short, all the technical
qualities of verse music, along with the
rich feeling and fine intelligence without which
those technical qualities would soon become
monotonous. When she is at her best, the
music melts in the caress of the emotion it expresses,
and thus completes the conditions
necessary for obtaining Shakespeare’s effects in
Shakespeare’s way.”</p>

<p>The memorable part of Ada Rehan’s career
was now about to close. Before Mr. Daly’s
death in 1899 she added to her long list of impersonations
Roxane in <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>,
Portia in <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, and Lady
Garnet in <i>The Great Ruby</i>, but none of these
brought her any added fame. Augustin Daly
died, in Paris, in June, 1899, and the great chapter
in Rehan’s life ended. Subsequently she
was the star of companies organized for her by
new managers, and in 1900 she appeared in a
new play, <i>Sweet Nell of Old Drury</i>, in which
she impersonated one of her famous predecessors,

<p>In the spring of 1901 Miss Rehan suddenly
ended her tour in this play, and sailed to Europe,
there to repair her broken health by living
for awhile at her bungalow on the coast of the
Irish Sea. She had been more or less ailing
all the season, and the loss of her mother in
January, 1901, added to her troubles. In
1903–04 she acted with Otis Skinner as a “co-star”
in plays from her old repertoire, <i>The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
Taming of the Shrew</i> and <i>The Merchant of
Venice</i> among them. One more season she
played, 1904–05, this time with Charles Richman
as her chief support, and then, on May 2, 1905,
she appeared on the stage for the last time,
when she took part in the farewell to Modjeska
at the Metropolitan Opera House, New York.
Rehan herself has never had such a testimonial,
though she deserved one as richly as the great
Polish actress. Unostentatiously she entered
her profession, so she pursued it, and so she
left it, slipping out of public life so quietly that
many playgoers were half consciously expecting
her reappearance years after she had quit the
stage for good. But she can have, as long as
she lives, the reward of as genuine a success as
can come to any actress. And it is also not beneath
notice that she accumulated a fortune.
Like Lotta Crabtree, Ada Rehan took good care
of her money. In 1891, when she had been in
Mr. Daly’s company twelve years, she was
“worth something like $300,000.” “She owns,”
says a contemporary account, “a $30,000 house
in New York, possesses mortgages on adjoining
property, and holds almost enough stock in a
New Jersey railroad to entitle her to the position
of director. She is not extravagant in anything
except her love for dogs.”</p>

<p>Of dogs, and other animal pets, she was fond.
She had a monkey, which Mr. Winter, with a
noticeable lack of enthusiasm, described as “an
interesting creature of its kind”; and she had,
wherever she traveled, a dog or two. “I have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
seen her wandering with her dog,” says Mr.
Winter “on the broad, solitary waste of the
breezy beach that stretches away, for many a
sunlit mile, in front of her sequestered cottage
on the Cumberland shore of the Irish Sea. She
was never so contented, never so radiant, never
so much herself, as in that beautiful retreat....
There, encompassed by associations of
natural beauty and of historic and poetic renown,
and surrounded by her books, pictures,
relics, music, and her pets, she was happy.”</p>

<p>Ada Rehan still lives, but, her work done,
she remains out of the public eye. She never
appears in the public print. She is not yet an
old woman, and has many years to enjoy the
memories of as true a triumph as an actress can
have. For by her exceptional, regally endowed
equipment and her devotion to her art, she upheld
the gospel of the actress,—poetry, beauty,
life.</p>

<h2 id="MARY_ANDERSON">MARY ANDERSON</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Though</span> a stage career was inevitable for
her, Mary Anderson did not come of theatrical
people. Her father, who died when she
was four, was of English birth and Oxford education,
and as he was a personally charming
man of artistic tastes and devoted to books and
the drama, it was undoubtedly from him that
she derived much of her temperamental equipment
for her work. Her mother, Marie Antoinette
Leugers, was a Philadelphian of
German parentage, one of a large family rigorously
trained in the Catholic faith. Pious
books, and not plays, formed the mental food
of that household, and the children were forbidden
to enter the theatre. The young
Marie had been but little outside this austere
circle when she met and loved the also youthful
Charles H. Anderson, who then lived in New
York. Opposition to the match was natural, as
young Anderson was not only not a Catholic
but was looked on by Marie’s parents as one
of the worldly. He seems to have been a thoroughly
estimable young man, however, who was
merely not of their stamp. When the young
couple were forbidden to see each other, it did
not take long for a secret correspondence to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
lead to an elopement. Anderson was apparently
of some means. He and his young wife,
then but eighteen, spent a leisurely year in New
York and Philadelphia, and in 1859 went by sea
to California. In Sacramento, at the Eagle
Hotel, on July 28, 1859, was born their daughter.
She was given almost her mother’s name—Mary
Antoinette Anderson. The young
mother, it will be remembered, was of a German
family. It is perhaps not too fanciful to
think that the beauty of Mary Anderson, which
was later the treasured boon of two countries,
was in part noticeably Teutonic and traceable
to her mother. But this beauty did not manifest
itself at once. The babe was red and ugly,
in the manner of babes, and the still childlike
mother was a week or so in reconciling herself
to her child’s unpromising aspect. Then, however,
also as usual, it was clear to her that there
never was such another baby.</p>

  <div class="caption">MARY ANDERSON</div></div>

<p>The mother’s family had never forgiven her
for her marriage. When, therefore, her husband
was called to England, she took her
year-old Mary, and in 1860 moved to Louisville,
Kentucky, where her uncle was the pastor of a
suburban German Catholic congregation. This
Pater Anton was a remarkable man. Born
and educated in Germany, he lived in Rome
ten years, and then in Texas. Learned and
eloquent, striking in appearance, kind and simple,
he was a great favorite with old and young.
He was soon to be a necessary guardian of the
little Anderson family, for Charles Anderson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
who had returned from England and was an
officer in the Confederate army, died in 1863,
still under thirty. Mary was not yet four,
and her little brother Joseph had been born
but a few months. It became the plan of the
good Pater Anton to train little Joseph as
his medical assistant, and Mary he thought
some day might be his housekeeper, his helper
with the poor, his assistant with the choir, and
his organist. How different this from the
career she was actually to have!<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<p>When Mary was eight her mother was married
again, to Dr. Hamilton Griffin, who had
been a surgeon-major in the Confederate army.
He was to become, during Mary’s later career,
her wise guide and her business manager.</p>

<p>At the time of this marriage Mary was sent
for the first time to school. She was taken to
the Convent of the Ursulines, near Louisville.
She was not at all a diligent student. She developed
early a liking for music, which with a
little German was about all she could bring
herself to study. It is clear that, with a likable
nature and a good disposition, she was still
somewhat of a problem for the good nuns who
were her teachers. At first she was utterly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
homesick,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> but after a term or so she began to
like the convent. Then her serious sickness
with a fever kept her at home, but after a year’s
rest she began school again, this time at the
Presentation Academy, a day school. In reading
she stood at the head of her class, but she
was indifferent to her other studies and was
continually punished for not knowing her lessons.
Mary Anderson, on whom thousands
were later to gaze as she stood, as Galatea, on
the statue’s pedestal, long before had practice
when she stood in the corner with a book balanced
on her head, or sat on the dunce-stool;
this second punishment she positively liked for
she could “see the girls better, and the seat
was so much more comfortable than the hard
benches.”</p>

<p>The little Mary Anderson of that day was a
high-spirited girl,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> keenly intelligent in spite of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
indolence in school, who better than study liked
acting childish plays with her baby sister and
brothers. One night, when she was twelve, she
heard for the first time the name of Shakespeare
and heard <i>Hamlet</i> read. It marked the beginning
of an epoch in her life. For days she
could think of nothing but <i>Hamlet</i> and the wonderful
book which had “suddenly become like
a casket filled with jewels.” A few nights later
she entered her surprised family circle wrapped
in a cloak and reciting a garbled version of one
of Hamlet’s speeches. From then on Shakespeare
was her constant companion and inspiration.
About the same time she saw her
first play—<i>Richard III</i>. Impressed and delighted
with this and other plays, she gradually
became a less forgetful and mischievous and a
much more thoughtful little girl. She and her
brother would go to the Saturday matinées,
arriving hours before the performance for the
pleasure of merely being in the land of enchantment
as long as possible.</p>

<p>When Mary was fourteen Edwin Booth came
to Louisville. Here was a turning point in her
life. After seeing him in <i>Richelieu</i>—the first
great acting she had seen—she spent a sleepless
night, her brain teeming with her impressions
of his art and with disturbing thoughts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
as to her own destiny. She then and there decided
on a stage career, and resolved to study
and to train herself. She kept her object a
secret, but made a bargain with her mother
whereby she promised to study diligently if allowed
to do so at home, for school had become
unendurable. The mother accepted, for Mary
could at least do no worse than she had at the
Academy. Now began a course of self-instruction
in Mary’s little room at the top of the
house. Not only did she make better progress
than ever in the ordinary branches, but she
carefully trained her own voice, worked hard
to overcome a natural awkwardness by fencing
and other exercises, and, above all in her
own mind, she memorized parts—Richard III,
Richelieu, Pauline in <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>, and
the Joan of Arc of Schiller. One evening she
astonished her mother and Dr. Griffin with a
scene from <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>. Especially,
was her stepfather impressed with the power
which Mary had suddenly revealed. At his solicitation
an actor from the local theatre called
to hear her read. This Henry Wouds was in
turn enough impressed to speak of the young
Miss Anderson to Charlotte Cushman, in whose
company he soon afterward acted. He sent
word that Miss Cushman would like to see the
young aspirant and hear her read. So Mrs.
Griffin reluctantly allowed herself to be persuaded
to take her daughter to Cincinnati,
where Miss Cushman was playing. The hearing
took place in the great actress’s hotel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
Richelieu and Joan of Arc were the parts selected.
When the trial was over, Miss Cushman,
somewhat to the mother’s dismay, not
only took Mary’s career as an actress for
granted, but thought it possible for her to begin,
not as usual at the bottom but, with a little more
training, in parts of importance. She counseled
a course of lessons from George Vandenhoff,
a veteran New York teacher of stage
technique.</p>

<p>At this point Mrs. Griffin’s thorough interest
and sympathy were won. She and Mary went
to New York, and the short term of ten lessons
of an hour each was undergone, not with entire
comfort for Mary, for her teacher found it constantly
necessary to repress her enthusiasm and
crude excess of vigor. The lessons were beneficial,
however (they were the only formal training
in stage work Mary Anderson ever had),
and she returned to Louisville and her attic
stage with unabated ambition. With no one but
her mother to guide her, Mary bent laboriously
to her task, renouncing all else. A year of this,
and she began to be discouraged, for there
seemed to be no prospects of actual appearance.
Then John McCullough came to Louisville. As
one of the most distinguished actors of that day,
his opinion and approval of Mary was sought
by the thoroughly enthusiastic Dr. Griffin. McCullough
came reluctantly to the Griffin home,
openly skeptical as to the beginner’s claim to
attention, and determined to stay but a quarter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
of an hour. He stayed for several hours, acted
with Mary scenes from all the plays she knew,
called frequently thereafter to act Shakespeare
with her, and ended by introducing and recommending
her to Barney Macauley, manager of
the Louisville Theatre, as an actress of great
promise.</p>

<p>It was this manager who gave Mary her first
opportunity to appear on a real stage. Casually
calling with Dr. Griffin at the theatre one
day, Mary was astonished and delighted to be
asked to play Juliet at a special performance,
but two nights later. She knew the part well,
joyfully accepted, and literally ran home to
tell the news to her mother. The published announcement
ran as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Saturday evening, November 27, 1875, Miss Mary
Anderson, a young lady of this city, will make her
first appearance on any stage as Juliet in Shakespeare’s
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; Milnes Levick as Mercutio,
and a powerful cast of characters.</p></blockquote>

<p>There was but one rehearsal, on the day before;
and on this occasion Mary’s ideals suffered
their first severe blow. The other actors
regarded her as an unpromising, awkward upstart,
and were markedly unhelpful and even
hostile.</p>

<p>At this time she was sixteen; the train of her
gown was the first she had ever worn; she had
never before faced a real audience from a real<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
stage; she had had but one imperfect rehearsal
with her fellow actors; yet she roused the house
to genuine enthusiasm. This cordial reception
was partly due to the first appearance of a
townswoman, and her impersonation was certainly
not without its crudities; yet the newspaper
accounts of the evening contain such
comments as these: “We are sure that last
night saw the beginnings of a career which will
shed radiance on the American stage”; “Her
achievement last night may be fairly classed as
remarkable”; “With but little further training
and experience she will stand among
the foremost actresses.” The audience was
thrilled by her rich and powerful voice, and
impressed by her beauty and vigor.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p>Mary Anderson’s career was thus suddenly
and on the whole auspiciously begun. It was
the old story of being prepared when the opportunity
presented itself.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> After waiting three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
months, during which she learned new parts,
she was offered a week at the Louisville
Theatre, in which she was to act, besides Juliet,
Bianca in <i>Fazio</i>, Julia in <i>The Hunchback</i>,
Evadne in the play of that name, and Pauline
in <i>The Lady of Lyons</i>. This week was a disappointment,
for the Louisville public did not
turn out in the numbers anticipated to see their
young actress. But in the week in St. Louis
which soon followed she was moderately successful.
Then came two weeks in New Orleans.
Miss Anderson’s reputation had not reached so
far, and the house had to be heavily “papered”
the first night to insure a respectably sized audience.
The business steadily improved, however,
and by the end of the two weeks her success
was almost overwhelming,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> coming as it
did in a strange city and on the heels of moderate
fortune at home. The students of the
Military College showered her with flowers, she
was made an honorary member of the famous
Washington Artillery Battalion, and as she
rode away from the city in the special car which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
the railroad had placed at her disposal, Generals
Beauregard and Hood and other distinguished
Southerners were at the station to bid
her farewell.</p>

<p>But if the New Orleans engagement was little
less than a triumph, her next important venture,
in San Francisco, was nothing more than
a disaster. It is an example of the heart-breaking
trials that come to the most successful actors
that Mary Anderson, phenomenally fortunate
so far, failed dismally in San Francisco
with both public and press. The engagement
was at John McCullough’s theatre, and it was
only on the last two nights that she made the anticipated
favorable impression. Much of this
trouble originated with the indifference or
worse of her fellow actors, the members of the
resident stock company. In those days a traveling
“star,” instead of taking with him on his
tours his own company, as at present, went
practically alone and depended for support on
the permanent stock company in each town—a
system which did not make for artistic excellence,
and which often gave occasion to just
such jealousy and hostility as helped to make
Mary Anderson’s stay in San Francisco unhappy.
There was one bright spot, however.
Edwin Booth was in the city, and she met him
for the first time. When she was tempted to
quit the stage disheartened, he said to her:
“I have sat through two of your performances
from beginning to end—the first time I have
done such a thing in years—and I have not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
only been interested but impressed and delighted.
You have begun well. Continue, and
you are sure of success in the end.” The
words were of immense encouragement.</p>

<p>There followed a tour of the South. In contrast
to the venture in the state of her birth,
Miss Anderson was successful everywhere.
She grew fond of the South and made in Washington
and elsewhere several of those friendships
for which her career was noteworthy.
There was a quality in Mary Anderson that attracted
and held the interest and affection of
the people best worth knowing. In Grant she
found a modest simplicity which she greatly
liked; in Sherman, a hearty personality and an
interest in what directly interested her—the
stage. General Sherman was a good enough
friend, indeed, to consider himself entitled to
correct the growing girl’s tendency to stoop,
and her illegible handwriting.</p>

<p>Still in her ’teens, Mary Anderson was by
now firmly established in her chosen profession.
The period just past had been full of discouragements
and difficulties, as well as triumphs.
Plunging as she did, without any training to
speak of, at once into the impersonation of
leading parts was an ordeal bound to result in
occasional failure. She afterwards said that
she would not wish her dearest enemy to pass
through the uncertainties and despondencies of
these early years—circumstances which she left
out of account on that sleepless night after seeing
Booth in <i>Richelieu</i>. She had come through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
the San Francisco ordeal, which was enough to
crush the spirit of a girl of seventeen. She
still suffered from want of systematic training,
she was still painfully conscious of the crudities
of her own work, and she lacked even the experience
of seeing others in the rôles in which
the public compared her with tried favorites.
She had seen Charlotte Cushman as Meg Merriles,
but as for Juliet, Evadne and Bianca, her
own feelings had been almost her sole resource.
Like that of Fanny Kemble and Garrick, her
novitiate, had, after all, been extraordinarily
brief.</p>

<p>There followed extensive tours which took her
throughout the South and Middle West, to Canada
and finally to the goal of American actors,
the larger Eastern cities, Philadelphia, Boston,
New York. In New York she profited by the
expert advice of Dion Boucicault and William
Winter, and the friendship of her elders in the
profession—Lawrence Barrett, Edwin Booth,
Joseph Jefferson and Clara Morris. In Boston
she formed another of her invaluable friendships—with
Longfellow. The old poet and the
young girl-artist delighted in each other’s company
and after her engagement was over, they
went several times to the opera together. Her
professional success in the Eastern cities was
such that she could now feel that the ordeal was
passed—that she had attained fame. Not that
she was by any means universally admired and
approved; a part of the public and some of
the critics were not won over. Such, while admitting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
her beauty and her promise, suspected
her success. It was, they said, too triumphant,
too easy. Yet the undoubted fact was that she
had won her public. The Boston engagement
was unmistakably successful and in New York
she enjoyed a “run” of six weeks.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
When she was nineteen Mary Anderson went
abroad, not to appear professionally, but for
a vacation. In England she went the round of
conventional sight-seeing, much like any other
tourist, but in Paris she saw something of the
French theatre and its actors. Herself accustomed
to the broad effects in acting, she was
at first disappointed by the restraint and <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">finesse</i>
of the French method. Bernhardt, then in her
early prime, received her cordially, saw much
of her, and even invited her to play Juliet in
Paris; but Miss Anderson, commendably conscious
of her own as yet imperfect technique,
declined. Now a privileged visiting artist behind
the scenes of the <i>Comédie Française</i>, she
recalled the days, not many years before, when
she and her small brother felt so privileged
when allowed to sit before the curtain of the
old theatre in Louisville. Ristori, another
great actress, was friendly to Miss Anderson;
but her greatest pleasure she found in the treasures
of the Louvre.</p>

<p>She returned to America refreshed in spirit
and broadened in outlook. She was now in her
twentieth year. One of the recognized stars of
the day, her name and her acting became increasingly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
familiar.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> There came invitations
from various English managers to appear in
London, but Miss Anderson did not yet feel
ready to face such a test of her powers. She
contented herself with starring tours which took
her here and there in the United States and
Canada. The artistic success of these years
was a varying quantity. As we shall see,
she never succeeded, in some eyes, in attaining
great heights. For herself, she felt that
her work had accomplished some good, that
her dream of early girlhood was to a degree
fulfilled. One great satisfaction was
that she was often assured in letters from
young men and women that her Ion or Evadne
or Parthenia had helped them over crises
of despondency and temptation. It speaks
well for her nobility of nature that in such
tributes she found her most gratifying applause.
She had no reason to be dissatisfied
with her measure of success. Yet stage life had
already begun in some ways to be distasteful
to her. She disliked the constant travel; she
sadly missed the home comforts at the command
of the humblest in her audiences; the
lack of ideals in those with whom she had to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
work was often a keen disappointment; and
above all she was acquiring a keen distaste for
the extreme publicity of stage life—the necessity
of constantly submitting herself to the public
gaze. She began to long for the quiet of
domestic life, but the die was cast; it was too
late to alter the tenor of her life, and she bent
all her energies toward success in a new opportunity
that presented itself.</p>

<p>This was an invitation that came when
she was twenty-four, to act in London, at
Henry Irving’s own theatre, the Lyceum.
Henry E. Abbey had taken the house for eight
months and relied upon Miss Anderson to keep
it open all that time—a formidable task for an
American actress new to London. She was extremely
apprehensive as to the outcome. Arriving
in England in the summer of 1883, she
passed some time quietly in the country before
going up to London. Rural England charmed
and rested her. At Stratford she studied her
Shakespeare in Shakespeare’s own house, and
spent many happy hours in the scenes familiar
to the poet so long her idol. She arrived in
London three months before the date of her
first appearance. She faced the greatest trial
of her career with a foreboding that was not
decreased by seeing the great acting of Irving
and Terry. When she chose <i>Ingomar</i> for the
opening bill, she heard predictions of failure
on every hand—the play had not been seen in
London for years and was called old-fashioned
and stilted. But Miss Anderson had wisely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
followed the sound advice of William Winter
in choosing Parthenia for her first London
part, as she thereby avoided awkward and possibly
unfriendly comparison with English favorites.</p>

<p>When the opening night came the thought
that almost on the scene of the triumphs of Siddons,
Garrick and Kean she was to venture before
a strange audience, filled her with dread.
She found in her dressing-room flowers from
actor friends and telegrams from Booth, McCullough,
Lawrence Barrett, Henry Irving,
Ellen Terry and other cordial well-wishers.
When she made her first entrance she was
greeted with the longest and heartiest burst of
applause that she had ever received. The first
scenes past, and her apprehension and despondency
somewhat allayed by such encouraging
cordiality, her feelings made it difficult for
her to speak loudly. A kindly voice from the
pit called out, “Mary, please speak up a bit!”
Her nervousness then fled, and by the time the
play was over it was plain that Mary Anderson
had scored a brilliant success. Her youth and
beauty, her admirable vigor, and her eight
years of patient, hard-working acquirement of
her art, had their reward. The Lyceum was
crowded nightly, and Mr. Abbey, who was prepared
to close the theatre in case the venture
was a failure, kept it open for eight months.
There were a few weeks of <i>Ingomar</i> and <i>The
Lady of Lyons</i> and then for the remaining time
<i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i>. On one of the first<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
nights the Prince and Princess of Wales asked
to be presented to the actress.</p>

<p>During the first months of her stay in
London she made her home—with her mother
and stepfather, who were with her constantly—in
Maida Vale, a secluded spot where she
was free from intrusion and noise. She made
many quick expeditions to scenes made famous
by Dickens, and went again to Stratford.
After a while, however, she moved to
a larger house in Kensington, and here London
society, at its best, began to find her out.
As in America, the choicest spirits seemed
naturally to gravitate toward her. To her
informal Sunday afternoon receptions came
artists, literary men, and statesmen. The “little
bent figure with its great kind heart” of the
novelist Wilkie Collins became familiar; Alma-Tadema,
the artist, was another; W. S. Gilbert
of Gilbert and Sullivan, and author of <i>Pygmalion
and Galatea</i>, naturally took a personal
interest in that play, and wrote for Miss Anderson
a new “curtain-raiser” for it, <i>Comedy
and Tragedy</i>. Browning she frequently met
and he seemed to her more like one of the old-school
Southern gentlemen than a mystic poet.
Either during this first season or the next she
numbered among her friends Mrs. Humphrey
Ward, James Russell Lowell, then American
ambassador, Edmund Gosse, Lord Lytton,
the artist Watts, Gladstone, the novelist William
Black, Cardinal Newman, and Tennyson.
She enjoyed to the full the art galleries of London,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
the opportunities to hear the best music,
and all the various activities and interests
which make London the capital of the English-speaking
world.</p>

<p>Mary Anderson’s success in London was
duplicated when she appeared elsewhere in the
British Isles. She was enthusiastically received
in Edinburgh and in Manchester. In
Dublin, the good-natured crowd every night
took the horses from her carriage and dragged
it through the streets, while those running
alongside shouted “Hurrah for America!” and
“God bless our Mary!” It was in Dublin, too,
that the ingenious “gallery gods” sent baskets
of flowers down to the stage over a rope.</p>

<p><i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was the play determined
upon for the next season in London. A trip to
Verona in quest of local data and sketches was
to occupy the summer. “What!” exclaimed
James Russell Lowell when he heard of this,
“going into that glorious country for the first
time, and in the flush of youth! I am selfish
enough to envy you.” While visiting in Paris
Miss Anderson had a charming interview with
Victor Hugo, who proposed a reception in her
honor. But she pressed on to Verona, and, like
many another before and since, found the old
city irresistible.</p>

<p>The Mary Anderson production of <i>Romeo
and Juliet</i> at the Lyceum in 1884 was lavish.
So much of her time indeed was taken by the
details of the preparation of scenery and other
accessories that she had scant opportunity for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
re-studying her own part. But her excellent
memory helped her immensely. Once, after
<i>Ion</i> had been dropped from her repertoire for
three or four years, she rehearsed her entire
long part without in the meantime reading it,
and with hardly a mistake. The circumstances
of the dress rehearsal of this production of
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> show how far the stagecraft
of the day had departed from the Elizabethan
custom. The scenes were so many and so
elaborate that though the rehearsal began at
seven in the evening, at five in the morning
Romeo, Juliet and Friar Laurence were still
waiting for the last act to be set. At eight in
the evening the public would be there. Discouraged
and weary, Miss Anderson could not
sleep; when she came to the theatre to face the
“first nighters,” she was tired in mind and
body and unfit for her work. The strain of
that performance was nerve-racking. Yet the
audience was unaware that Juliet had all she
could do to get through her lines, and the cumbersome
scenery was set with amazing rapidity.
The play was over at half after eleven, a
great success; yet to the actress herself her
work that night was more painfully unsatisfactory
than any other she ever did. But she
was hard to please where her own impersonations
were concerned. In her fourteen years
before the public, she was satisfied with her
acting only once as Bianca, once as Ion, never
as Perdita and only once as Hermione.
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i> ran, however, for a hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
nights. Mary Anderson became so imbued
with the sufferings of Juliet that she continually
spoke of them in her sleep. It is typical
of her that, profoundly dissatisfied with her
impersonation, she constantly restudied and remodeled
it until she liked it better. The brother
Joe, who used to gaze with Mary on the green
curtain of the Louisville Theatre, was the Tybalt
of this production.</p>

<p>At this time (1885) it was proposed that
Mary Anderson play <i>As You Like It</i> in the
Shakespeare Memorial Theatre at Stratford,
and she gladly accepted. She had never played
Rosalind, and she studied the character carefully.
The occasion aroused great interest,
and the usually placid village was a gay place.
The journalists were there from London, people
came from far and near for the play, the
stage was decorated with flowers from Shakespeare’s
own garden. The audience was distinguished
and appreciative. The dean of
American critics, William Winter, was present,
and, in his words, “It was for her [Miss
Anderson] that the audience reserved its enthusiasm,
and this, when at length she appeared
as Rosalind, burst forth in vociferous plaudits
and cheers, so that it was long before the familiar
voice, so copious, resonant, and tender,
rolled out its music upon the eager throng and
her action could proceed. Before the night
ended she was continually cheered.” After a
provincial tour ending in Dublin, where her
admirers gathered in thousands under her window<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
and sang <i>Come Back to Erin</i>, Miss Anderson
in September, 1885, returned to her own
country after an absence of two years.</p>

<p>The accounts that preceded her of the remarkable
scene that took place in the Lyceum
on her last night in London added interest to
her reappearance in America. One who was
present that night wrote: “During the evening
it was manifest from the fervor of the applause
with which she was favored during the
performance of <i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i> and
<i>Comedy and Tragedy</i> that the audience was
exceptionally sympathetic, but no idea of the
scenes which followed the descent of the curtain
even entered the wildest dreams of any
one present. The audience had been all the
evening quivering with emotion. As the curtain
fell Miss Anderson was loudly called for,
and after the storm of applause which greeted
her presence had subsided to some extent, the
lady, who was transfigured with the excitement
of the moment, said: ‘Ladies and gentlemen—the
dreaded last night has come—dreaded at
least by me. I have to part with you who have
been so kind to me. The delight I naturally
feel at the prospect of returning to my native
country is tempered with a great regret, saddened
by the thought that I must leave you.
I little imagined when I came before you for
the first time, a stranger feeling very helpless,
tremblingly wondering what your verdict on
my poor efforts would be, how soon I should
find friends among you or what pain it would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
cost me to say, as I must say to-night, “good-bye”
to you. You have been very, very good.
I have tried hard to deserve your goodness.
Please do not quite forget me. I can never
forget you or your goodness to me. I hope I
am not saying good-bye to you forever. I
want to come back to you. [Tumultuous applause
and cries of ‘Do! Do!’ ‘Why leave at
all?’] Dare I hope you will be a little glad to
see me. [Loud cries ‘We will!’ ‘Yes!’ etc.]
I shall be very glad to see you. [Immense
cheers.] Until I do, good-bye. I thank you
again and again.’ At the conclusion of the
speech the cheering and applause continued
without interruption until Miss Anderson—down
whose cheeks tears were pouring—had
again come eight times before the curtain. The
audience, which by this time was on its feet in
every part of the house, and wildly waving
handkerchiefs and hats, seemed struck by one
thought, and the first strain of <i>Auld Lang
Syne</i> seemed to burst simultaneously from
stalls and gallery. People who had never met
before seized and wrung each other’s hands.
Ladies wept and flourished their handkerchiefs
hysterically. It is impossible to describe the
scene. When I tell you that it lasted for fully
half an hour, you will get an idea of what the
Englishman, whom you Yankees call phlegmatic,
can do in the way of enthusiasm when
you touch his heart. It was an ovation which
might have affected a monarch.”</p>

<p>The American tour that followed, in the season<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
of 1885–6, took Miss Anderson and her company
(the custom by now was that of the traveling
organization) not only to New York, Boston,
and the other cities in the East and South,
but to the Pacific coast. New York did not
take to <i>As You Like It</i>, but <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i> was a brilliant success. A public reception
in Sacramento proved the affection for
Mary Anderson of the city of her birth, but,
strange to say, in the single night she played
there, the people of Sacramento provided her
with only a meagre audience. In San Francisco
the warmth of her reception was very
different from the crushing disappointment
she experienced there a dozen years before.</p>

<p>Now came an entire year of rest. Offers to
play in Spain, Germany, France and Australia
were refused. The glamour of stage life was a
thing of the past with Mary Anderson. By no
means blind to the artistic possibilities of the
drama, and with still a high faith in its moral
function, a stage life for herself was becoming
more and more repugnant. She felt the
need of calm, of normal life away from the
glare of the footlights. The winter of 1886–7
she spent in Paris, in general study and particularly
with her French and music. It is
characteristic of her that with a chance for
recreation and social life, and with all her triumphs
behind her, she still sought to mend an
education she knew to be faulty.</p>

<p>The Lyceum in London was engaged for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
following year (1887–8). After casting about
for some time for a suitable new play,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a> she
again fell back on Shakespeare and decided to
give <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, “doubling” Perdita
and Hermione—that is, playing both parts.
It was not an easy task. To Tennyson she
mentioned her fear that the critics would not
receive the venture well. His reply was:
“Thank God the time is past for the <i>Quarterly</i>
or the <i>Times</i> to make or mar a poem, play or
artist! Few original things are well received
at first. People must grow accustomed to what
is out of the common before adopting it. Your
idea, if carried out as you feel it, will be well received
generally—and before long.”</p>

<p><i>The Winter’s Tale</i> was not enthusiastically
received on its first night. But if it was not
at once a critical success, it was a popular one,
for it ran a hundred and sixty-four nights and
could have continued longer. This was the
only time that Mary Anderson acted the same
play throughout a season. It is worth mentioning
that the Leontes of this production was
J. Forbes-Robertson.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
It was during this London engagement that
Miss Anderson saw much of Tennyson. She
visited him in his Surrey home, and on the Isle
of Wight; she joined him in long walks, rain or
shine, in the country; he read and talked to her
for hours together at his own fireside. He prepared
for her a play <i>The Foresters</i>, a version
of his pastoral <i>Robin Hood</i>, and they visited
the New Forest together in search of ideas for
scenery; but the play she never produced.</p>

<p>Mary Anderson was to have but one more
season, or rather part of a season, before retiring
from the stage forever. She has become
the classic example of the actor retiring in the
midst of a highly successful career. She has
herself<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> indicated the chief reason for her
choice: “After so much kindness from the
public, it seems ungrateful to confess that the
<em>practice</em> of my art (not the study of it) had
grown, as time went on, more and more distasteful
to me. To quote Fanny Kemble on
the same subject: ‘Never’ (in my case for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
last three years of my public life) ‘have I presented
myself before an audience without a
feeling of reluctance, or withdrawn from their
presence without thinking the excitement I had
undergone unwholesome, and the personal exhibition
odious.’ To be conscious that one’s
person was a target for any one who paid to
make it one; to live for months at a time in one
groove, with uncongenial surroundings, and in
an atmosphere seldom penetrated by the sun
and air; and to be continually repeating the
same passions and thoughts in the same words—that
was the most part of my daily life, and
became so like slavery to me that I resolved
after one more season’s work to cut myself
free from the stage fetters forever.”</p>

<p>There is much in this passage to give pause
to the girl who longs for a stage career, for the
youthfully ambitious seldom see such a career
in its true perspective. Mary Anderson, one
in ten thousand in her equipment as an actress,
one in a million in the triumphs she won, yet
was eager to give it all up. On the audience’s
side of the footlights the stage is (and rightfully
so) a place of beauty, of inspiration, of
revelation of the truth. To the actor or actress
it is more often than not a place of stern toil,
of uncertainty, of disappointment and disillusionment.</p>

<p>The provincial tour following the London
engagement ended at Dublin, where the public
was as wildly enthusiastic as before. Some of
the last night audience even went so far as to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
follow in the same train to Queenstown, awakening
her at each stop with cheers and greetings.</p>

<p>There followed the final tour in the United
States. At Louisville she visited the scenes of
her youth and received the congratulatory
resolutions of the state senate. She had begun
the season with as much zest as she could command,
but the strain was beginning to tell on
her health. At Cincinnati she acted with difficulty,
but completed the engagement. At
Washington, in the middle of inauguration
week, in 1889, the crisis was reached. “The
first scenes of <i>The Winter’s Tale</i> went very
smoothly. The theatre was crowded. Perdita
danced apparently as gayly as ever, but after
the exertion fell fainting from exhaustion and
was carried off the stage. I was taken into the
dressing-room, which in a few moments was
filled with people from the boxes. Recovering
consciousness quickly, I begged them to clear
the room. Realizing then that I would probably
not be able to act any more that season,
though there were many weeks yet unfinished,
I resolved at any cost to complete that night’s
work. Hurriedly putting on some color, I
passed the groups of people discussing the incident,
and before the doctor or my brother were
aware of my purpose, ordered the curtain to
be rung up and walked quickly upon the stage.
As I did so I heard a loud hum, which I was
afterwards told was a great burst of applause
from the audience. The pastoral scene came<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
to an end. There was only one more act to
go through. Donning the statue-like draperies
of Hermione, I mounted the pedestal. My
physician, formerly an officer in the army, said
that he had never, even in the midst of a battle,
felt so nervous as when he saw the figure
of Hermione swaying on her pedestal up that
long flight of stairs. Every moment there was
an hour of torture to me, for I felt myself
growing fainter and fainter. All my remaining
strength was put into that last effort. I
descended from the pedestal, and was able to
speak all but the final line. This remained unuttered,
and the curtain rang down on my last
appearance on the stage.”<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
A little over a year after this unexpected
close to her brilliant public career Mary Anderson
became Mrs. Antonio F. de Navarro. Her
husband was a native of New York, of Spanish
extraction, and like herself, of Catholic faith.
They were married on June 17, 1890, at the
Catholic church at Hampstead, London. During
the last half dozen years of her stage career
Mary Anderson had become almost an Englishwoman
by adoption. Her new home was made
in the little village of Broadway, Worcestershire,
and there she has always since lived, enjoying
the peaceful life and the domestic happiness
for which she longed and which she so
richly deserved. She has two children, a son
and a daughter. There have not been lacking
attempts to tempt her again behind the footlights.
Enormous sums have been offered
without the least effect. For charity she has
read or sung once or twice in modest programs,
but that is all. The people of Broadway fairly
worship her for the gracious and kindly lady
she is. Since her marriage she has made a few
visits to America, and the American public of
the theatre was recently reminded of the former
light of its stage when she assisted Robert
Hichens in the dramatization of <i>The Garden
of Allah</i>. But Mary Anderson, though she is
now well under sixty, for a quarter of a century
has been to most of us only an illustrious name
of the past, and to our elders a tenderly treasured
memory.</p>

<p>The estimate of Mary Anderson with which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
she has usually been dismissed by the casually
critical is that she was not a great actress, but
an unusually handsome, charming and talented
woman who is memorable chiefly as a demonstration
that the stage can be the working place
of a wholesome, womanly woman.</p>

<p>As to whether she was a great actress there
was and is a wide difference of opinion. To
her more partial admirers she was the “authentic
queen of the American stage,” who in each
of her parts “gave an individual and potential
impersonation.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> “Such moments in her
acting,” wrote William Winter, who has always
been her friend and admirer, “as that of
Galatea’s mute supplication at the last of
earthly life, that of Juliet’s desolation after the
final midnight parting with the last human
creature whom she may ever behold, and that
of Hermione’s despair when she covers her face
and falls as if stricken dead, are the eloquent,
the absolute, the final denotements of genius.”</p>

<p>A great deal of contemporary criticism was
decidedly less enthusiastic than this. While
thoroughly believing in Miss Anderson’s devotion
to her profession and her conviction of its
dignity, many good judges saw in her a woman
of talent only, not a genius. The art of the
theatre was to her a matter of the highest
ideals, deserving the service of the best and
noblest in the natures of its followers. Yet as
an actress practicing this art she seemed to
many incapable of placing her work on any but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
a personal basis. Insight into character, it was
said, was impossible to her—her Galatea, Parthenia,
Pauline, Rosalind and the rest were but
herself in different guises. A striking instance
of her lack of dramatic insight was her inability
to adapt herself to W. S. Gilbert’s conception
of his own <i>Galatea</i>. He wished her to
suggest the comic or satiric value of some of
her speeches, but she was unable to bring about
the necessary subordination of her own personality.
The heroic and obviously tragic were
her forte. A thoroughly good woman herself,
she was rigidly confined by the limits of her
temperament, as well as by her views of what
the stage should show, to the delineation of
good women. She was probably quite incapable
of expressing a purely animal nature.
“Her acting is polished, and in correct taste,”
said the <i>Morning Post</i> of London, “what it
wants is freshness, spontaneity, <em>abandon</em>. Of
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">feu sacre</i> which irradiated Rachel and
gives to Bernhardt splendor ineffable, Miss
Anderson has not a spark. She is not inspired.
Hers is a pure, bright, steady light; but it lacks
any mystic effulgence. She is beautiful, winsome,
gifted, and accomplished. To say this is
to say much, and it fills to the brim the measure
of legitimate praise. She is an eminently
good, but not a great artist.”</p>

<p>The word “beautiful” is sure to turn up in
any criticism of Mary Anderson. Never was
the word used with more justification. She
was “a classic figure gotten by mistake into an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
unclassic epoch.” She was of innate dignity,
tall and statuesque, “of imperial figure,” fair
haired, blue-eyed. Her features were finely
chiseled and regular and at once suggested the
Greek ideal. Her voice, rich, tender, and with
wonderfully full bodied and expressive lower
tones, was one of her chief charms. Many men
today have those tones still echoing in their
minds.</p>

<p>But the spell of her beauty was that it
seemed more than skin-deep. It was the expression
of a noble temperament, the beauty of
a woman of high feeling and sensitiveness, and
yet of dignity. It was an essential part of her
appeal, though this was not an appeal to the
eye alone. It was the beauty of the actress,
who could be sincerely concerned first of all
with the ideals of her art, of the woman who
could say: “The highest praise I receive is the
knowledge that someone has gone from the
audience with an increased light as to the development
of character, a higher sense of moral
responsibility, a better spiritual condition for
having seen the play.”</p>

<p>Whether or not this beautiful woman was a
great actress, she was “our Mary” to countless
thousands, and such a title is not earned by
commonplaceness and dignity, however beautiful.
About Mary Anderson there hangs
somehow a sense of enchantment, of the realization
of an ideal of loveliness, joy and purity.
And whether or not she was a genius, there is
something heroic in the amplitude of her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
career. She began as a poor girl, living in an
obscure place, without connection with the
theatre. By her noble aspirations, her zeal and
patience in their pursuit, and her modesty and
worth in their fulfillment, she succeeded
gloriously.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the autumn of 1915, in a performance for the
benefit of one of the British war-charities, Mary Anderson
acted the sleep-walking scene from <i>Macbeth</i>
and the balcony scene from <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>.</p></blockquote>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="MRS_FISKE">MRS. FISKE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">One</span> afternoon a decade ago Minnie Maddern
Fiske journeyed out from Boston to
the neighboring university city, went to Sanders
Theatre, scene of Harvard’s august ceremonies,
and there she talked—engrossingly—on
her art. The occasion was in a way memorable.
In times not remotely past the possibility
of an actress lecturing in Sanders would have
been doubtful.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> But in 1905 Harvard was well
along in its career as one of the springs of the
renaissance which has of late years manifested
itself in the English-speaking theatre. If one
said “Professor Baker’s work was beginning
to make itself felt” it would be saying the same
thing in a different way. In many respects the
occasion was unusual The audience was interesting:
the professors were there to add dignity
and academic distinction; the students, of
Harvard and Radcliffe, were there in force to
represent the newer spirit of inquiry and effort
in matters dramatic; the stage was represented
in the audience as well as on the platform (and,
oddly, Francis Wilson, Edward H. Sothern and
the speaker cover nearly the whole dramatic
range). There was an enthusiastic expectancy
in the air. One felt that here was the manifestation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
of something genuine and strong.
The speaker did not disappoint. Poised and
confident, eager and enthusiastic, she spoke for
more than an hour and one felt at the end that
this small woman had signalized a new spirit in
the theatre and in the attitude of educated men
toward the drama and its exponents.</p>

  <img src="images/i_293.jpg" width="399" height="600" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">MRS. FISKE</div></div>

<p>She had started life as a baby actress and
her formal schooling was snatched here and
there in the midst of an ever busy career. Most
men (and women) can exhaust the resources
of academic training with a total result less brilliant,
however, than her hour on the stage of
Sanders. But it was only one form of a recognition
which is freely accorded. It is quite safe
to say that since the death of Mansfield she has
been the most noteworthy American person of
the theatre. She has consistently championed
drama of a high order, which is something
superior to theatrical art of a high order. So
much would be true if she remained the producer
only. Mrs. Fiske, the actress, has placed
herself among the chosen few. She, as much
as any other, brought to bear on the American
theatre what it sorely needed, a keen intellect
attuned to the new spirit of naturalism.
She was born in a lucky day for this purpose,
for, as we shall see, she came to maturity at
just about the time when the rebirth in the
English drama was making itself evident.</p>

<p>The stage always attracts to itself numbers
of people who no doubt sincerely fancy themselves
drawn thither irresistibly. The theatre’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
lure is strong, yet most of its followers
have entered upon a stage career more or less
as a matter of choice. With a small number,
however, the life has been inevitable. There
has been no choice, no attraction or glamour
even. Such is Mrs. Fiske; she is indigenously
of the theatre.</p>

<p>Early in the last century an English girl of
good family eloped with her music teacher.
Here, perhaps, began Minnie Maddern’s artistic
career, for this girl was her grandmother.
After a while this music master brought his
family to America, where he conducted concert
tours. One daughter, Lizzie Maddern, the
mother of Mrs. Fiske, not only was the youthful
cornetist of the company, but she arranged
the music for the orchestra and, indeed, became
a musician of genuine ability, and, later,
an acceptable actress. She married Thomas
Davey, a pioneer theatrical manager who carried
his company up and down through the
South and West in the days before personal
management gave way to the highly impersonal
direction of the Broadway offices. Davey was
noted for his invasion of small unheard-of
towns, where often the inn dining-room served
as a theatre and scenery was of the scantiest.
The actor’s life has its uncertainties and hardships
in any age or country, but in Western
America of the middle of the nineteenth century
the conditions were often those known by
the strolling players of old. As we shall see,
Mrs. Fiske long afterward, and for quite different<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
reasons, reverted for a time to the old
practice of playing on extemporized stages.</p>

<p>On December 19, 1865, Marie Augusta Davey
was born in New Orleans. From the first of her
stage career, which began almost immediately,
she was known as Minnie Maddern. There is a
pretty story of her first, quite informal stage
appearance. A careless nurse had left the
baby unguarded. She climbed from her bed,
donned her clothes and went out in search of
the theatre and her mother. “I forgot to cry,
I forgot to be frightened, and I saw some fascinating
things before a good-natured fellow
picked me up, discovered my identity and took
me safely to the theatre. I recall distinctly
being held by my new friend and identified at
the box-office; then being passed over to a boy
who took me around to a narrow, dark door
and carried me into a lumbery place and put
me in a chair where I looked out into what
seemed a bright, sunshiny world with queer
trees and fairies. Just then I spied my mother.
She was dressed like a fairy, and she was just
coming out of a water lily—for it was the transformation
scene of a spectacle. I slipped right
out of that chair, and, before any one saw what
I was going to do, I ran right to her and
began explaining my nurse’s treachery. I am
told that I was received with applause, and that
my first appearance, even though it was impromptu,
was a success.”</p>

<p>Previously, she had been “taken on” when
the action required the presence of a baby, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
soon afterwards little Minnie appeared between
the farce and the tragedy to do her songs and
dances. At three came her first premeditated
speaking appearance,<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> as the Duke of York in
<i>Richard III</i>, and from that day to this, excepting
brief periods in school<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> and a few
years at the time of her marriage to Harrison
Grey Fiske, in 1890, she has been continuously
and busily engaged in her profession.</p>

<p>Her career divides sharply into two periods.
To the first of these, the twenty-five years that
carried her to the time of her marriage, she is
now disposed to be rather indifferent. When
she refers at all to that time, which is not often,
she speaks of the “prehistoric days.”<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> It was,
nevertheless, a period of thorough schooling,
arduous, but fruitful of technical excellence,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
and bringing early triumphs—a babyhood
and girlhood apprenticeship which is today,
for various reasons (one of them being laws
in some states restricting the appearance of
children on the stage) practically inaccessible.
To indicate briefly her early experience
it is enough to say that before she was sixteen
Minnie Maddern had appeared not only with
her father’s company, but with a dozen or more
of the stars of the day, Laura Keene, J. K. Emmet,
Lucille Western, John McCullough, Joseph
Jefferson, E. L. Davenport, and the rest of that
almost forgotten day. She went through the
whole range of juvenile parts,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> soubrettes,
harassed young heroines, boys, fairies, the lads
of Shakespeare’s plays, and so on through the
list, playing wherever the need of a clever child
actress called her. She wore long dresses on
the stage long before she assumed them in her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
own person, and by the time she was sixteen
she was conspicuously successful in old woman
rôles!<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> At sixteen, too, she became a star in
New York, though this venture was ill-advised.
She had won a public by her cleverness and her
marked personality, but, much to her credit,
she was not adapted to the crude and blatantly
personal form of entertainment represented
by <i>Fogg’s Ferry</i>, which was one of the “protean
shows” of those days. She was to wait,
indeed, many years more for the beginning of
her identification with really significant drama.
During this young womanhood, from sixteen to
twenty-odd, she acted in plays which are never
resurrected nowadays by even the most undiscriminating
stock company, and which are remembered,
if at all, by some old theatregoer
who likes to recollect how appealingly, in
<i>Caprice</i>, Minnie Maddern used to sing “In the
Gloaming.” <i>The Storm Child</i>, <i>In Spite of All</i>,
<i>The Child Wife</i>, <i>The Puritan Maid</i>, <i>Lady
Jemima</i>, <i>Featherbrain</i>—these are not so much
as names nowadays, even to those who know
the theatre well. She had gained thorough,
indispensable training, but as yet no memorable
achievement.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
In 1890 came her marriage and three years
of retirement.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> It is, for many reasons, not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
strange that when she again took up her stage
career a new era seemed to begin for her. Not
only must her own nature, her insight, and her
artistic equipment now have combined to qualify
her for new and greater efforts; the
whole English speaking theatre was gaining a
new lease of life. Arthur Wing Pinero, just
emerging into his period of sureness of technique
and a frank facing of life; Henry Arthur
Jones, dropping his earlier melodramatic manner
and about to produce <i>Michael and His Lost
Angel</i>; Oscar Wilde, with his momentary flash
of high comedy; George Bernard Shaw, watchful
of the experimentation of others and in addition
well saturated with Ibsen; above all, the
great Norwegian himself, whose influence knew
no difference of language;—these men were, in
the early nineties, bringing into English drama
a vigor and a relation to life such as it had not
enjoyed since the closing of the theatres in 1642.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fiske was keenly, if to a certain degree
unconsciously, alive to these influences. To
one attuned they were the <i xml:lang="de" lang="de">zeitgeist</i>. With an
eagerness new to the American theatre she was
ambitious to attempt the modern drama—a
drama honest and frank in its outlook on life,
free from conventional restraint in its choice of
themes, and taking its tone from the realities
in human character. Not always have the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
qualities of the play been a match for the
powers of the actress. Yet, looking over the
period since 1893,<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> the list is distinctly noteworthy—first
of all, Ibsen, who found in Mrs.
Fiske a ready champion. <i>A Doll’s House</i>,
<i>Hedda Gabler</i>, <i>Rosmersholm</i>, <i>The Pillars of
Society</i>; surely they form a goodly showing.
As for other Europeans, we have Sardou furnishing
her, in <i>Divorçons</i>, an opportunity, brilliantly
embraced, for comedy; Dumas <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">fils</i> is
represented by <i>La Femme de Claude</i>, Sudermann
by <i>Magda</i>, and Hauptmann by the short
play <i>Hannele</i>. Two of her greatest successes,
<i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i> and <i>Becky Sharp</i> were
unusually skillful and satisfying experiments in
that difficult form, the dramatized novel. <i>Leah
Kleschna</i> was worth while as an attempt to
raise melodrama into the field of social drama;
<i>The New York Idea</i> is, so far, the best American
example of sophisticated, ironic comedy;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
and in very recent days Edward Sheldon’s
plays, <i>Salvation Nell</i> and <i>The High Road</i>, have
been courageous and justified experiments—the
most striking examples we have had of the
encouragement of the native dramatist of the
newer school.</p>

<p>The capacity to key oneself to the inner
meaning of a play, to react on the genius of the
author with sympathy and insight, sets apart the
artist from the crowd of mechanical players.
For different actors there are naturally different
forms of this power. For Mrs. Fiske, it can
be said that her genius displays itself in the
naturalism that reveals at once the realities and
the beauties of human nature. Let us see how
the group of representative plays named above
has represented this power.</p>

<p>It can fairly be said that the distinguishing
mark of this group of plays has been its close
relation to actual human life. This is of course
the distinguishing work of the most characteristic
and significant of modern English drama
as a whole; but there is much more of this sort
of drama now than there was eighteen or twenty
years ago, and there has been, until very recently,
more of this leaven of truth to nature
in the British theatre than in the American.
Consider for a moment the character of the average
play upon which the public in the United
States spent during this period (and rightly
enough still spends) millions of dollars and
hours. To name a few undoubted successes:
<i>When Knightwood was in Flower</i>, <i>The Heart of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
Maryland</i>, <i>Lovers’ Lane</i>, <i>The Christian</i>, <i>Way
Down East</i>, <i>Secret Service</i>, <i>The Music Master</i>,
<i>The Man from Home</i>, <i>Zaza</i>, <i>Charley’s Aunt</i>,
<i>The Prisoner of Zenda</i>, <i>Sherlock Holmes</i>, <i>The
Chorus Lady</i>, <i>Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm</i>,
<i>The Woman</i>, <i>Get-Rich-Quick Wallingford</i>.
Without denying the necessity of the theatre of
mere amusement, of light sentiment, of melodrama,
one feels grateful for an ambition that
has sought and found something deeper.</p>

<p>To examine Mrs. Fiske’s plays more in detail
will indicate both the temper of the modern
realistic school and the quality of her interpretations.</p>

<p>As for Ibsen, there has been warm dispute
as to the validity and helpfulness of his message.
Many go to the extreme of saying that
he should never be performed at all. With this
question we are now concerned only so far as to
determine his attitude toward life and the
drama for there is no question as to his strength
in determining the tone and technique of later-day
dramatists. As Mrs. Fiske herself
has said, “the most interesting, the most valuable
plays written by others are almost without
exception pieces which display the influence
of the Norseman’s work. It would be an impertinence
to say that Sudermann, Fulda, Pinero,
d’Annunzio and the Spanish playwright
Echegaray do not write interesting plays.
They do, but after all their works are merely
those of devoted disciples—not those of the
master.” To follow her in her Ibsen creed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
(and she has the best critical thought with her)
is to believe him responsible for our search of
truth in the theatre, for the truth to nature that
has brought a toning down of violent action and
heightened the desire, as Maeterlinck says, “to
penetrate deeper and deeper into human consciousness
and place moral problems upon a
high pedestal. Bloodshed has grown less frequent,
passions less turbulent; heroism has become
less unbending, courage less material and
less ferocious.” Ibsen appeals to the actor’s
imagination, to all he has of brain and soul. In
these plays also the sensitive, discerning auditor
finds, not the sordid pessimism with which
Ibsen has been so often charged, but a burning
zeal for rockbottom truth and sincerity and, in
some cases, the exaltation of tragedy. It is to
be admitted that in his reaction against the
drama of futile romanticism, the “story book
play” of no character or consequence, Ibsen
drew what were, in contrast, grim pictures.</p>

<p>By her unmistakable vocation for the realistic
drama, her intellectual acumen, her power
and habit of thinking out her parts, both in
their larger significance and in their revealing
details, Mrs. Fiske was obviously fitted for Ibsen.
The restlessness of his women, their curiosity,
their keen concentration, found a response
in her temperament as her blonde and
nervous person pictured their physical aspect.
Histrionic methods moreover adapted themselves
to both mood and matter. It is interesting
to inquire in a little detail what these methods<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
were and are, for, with modifications, they
characterize all her work.</p>

<p>The keynote of Mrs. Fiske’s acting is akin to
that of naturalistic drama itself, as the dramatist
himself understands it. He must portray
humanity as it is, with the selection and stress
necessary for effectiveness in the theatre. His
heroines must be embodied through similar
methods. Such impersonation Mrs. Fiske accomplishes
with the utmost economy of gesture,
action and voice. There is no staginess, none
of the aggressive grace of the actress playing
a part; she is rather the woman living it.
There is obvious none of the routine technique
which actors frequently learn of each other,
or in schools. This is not to say that her style
is not an outgrowth of an earlier technique of a
period when no doubt she was sufficiently
“stagey” and conventional. In the later
period she has refined, out of this earlier experience
and her own insight, a method remarkable
for its suggestion, its repression, its freedom
from familiar device. To the end of
theatric effect and illusion she, like all artists,
has well defined, recognizable means—some,
like her wide-ranged, emotion-charged voice,
natural gifts; others more or less deliberate.
How deliberate, it would be hard to say, so
closely knit in good acting are calculation and
instinctive action. Her power of imparting
the details of impersonation is notable. Gesture,
walk, pose, facial play, intonation, pause,
all are worked out with precision and yet with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
a reticent naturalness that makes strongly for
effectiveness. Particularly convincing is her
power of pregnant silence. In Hedda Gabler,
“Mrs. Fiske’s power of ominously significant
silence, of play of feature that reveals the
working brain behind, rises very high in the
final scene with Brack. He knows her share in
Lovborg’s ruin; he can bring his knowledge
into play in the sordid theatre of the police
court. The price of silence is the submission
that Hedda, with all her curiosity and zest for
evil, is too coldly cowardly to pay. All her
tragedy has curdled mean. Her only refuge is
the meaner and cowardly escape of suicide.
She does not speak, yet one sees the idea germinate,
mount and possess her, until it flowers
into reckless action.”<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<p>In the first act of <i>Salvation Nell</i> “Mrs. Fiske,
as the scrub woman in the barroom, sat holding
her drunken lover’s head in her lap for fully
ten minutes without a word, almost without a
motion. Gradually one could watch nothing
else; one became absorbed in the silent pathos
of that dumb, sitting figure. Miss Mary Garden,
herself a distinguished actress, said of
this, ‘Ah, to be able to do nothing like that.’
In <i>Pillars of Society</i>, while the Consul was
making his confession to the mob, again Mrs.
Fiske, as Lona, sat quiet, one of the crowd; but
gradually, as she saw the man she loved throwing
off his yoke of hypocrisy, the light of a
great joy radiated from her face, ending in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
stifled cry, half-sob, half-laugh of triumph, of
indescribable poignancy. To one beholder, at
least, it brought the rush of tears, and made
the emotional as well as the intellectual drift
of the play completely clear, completely fused
and compelling. Is not this acting of a very
high order, this so intense living in the whole
life of the drama that her quietest moment is
charged with tingling significance? Is this not
true ‘impersonation,’ indeed?”<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<p>Akin to this power of eloquent silence is Mrs.
Fiske’s use of “felicitous pause.” In the
middle of a sentence, sometimes in the middle
of a word, will come a momentary halt such as
anyone in real life is constantly making. The
effect is strikingly realistic; the wonder is that
many others have not discovered and profited
by its simplicity and naturalness. And then,
coupled with her many sided faculty of repression,
is a power of sudden, telling, emotional
speech. Piercing a mood of charged silence,
a sentence spoken in Mrs. Fiske’s eloquent
voice is often of electrical effect.</p>

<p>By such methods, she made Hedda, “an abnormally
evil and soulless woman, steadily
plausible, momentarily potent, always conceivably
human.” In the words of the same critic<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a>
she gave to Nora, in <i>A Doll’s House</i> “the very
semblance of life. When these traits (disdain
of convention, curiosity, self-concentration) become
abnormal and pass over into morbid<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
chagrin and recklessness, sordid selfishness,
vicious vindictiveness, hard soullessness and
mean cowardice, Mrs. Fiske’s intellect and her
temperament follow them.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fiske’s Rebecca West in <i>Rosmersholm</i>
excited differences of opinion. To some any
Ibsen play is a brilliant study of certain phases
of life, to others only a depressing study in degeneracy.
It is natural that the actress’ work
should make varied impressions. In the moments
of intense passion she rose superbly to
the occasion; her Rebecca had intellectual
poise; she suggested beautifully Rebecca’s renouncing
love. It was, as far as it went, a
portrait equal to any of her others, but in a
degree she failed to suggest plausibly the fascinating
half-intellectual and half-emotional
force that gave Rebecca her influence in Rosmer’s
house. She was a shade too detached, a
little lacking in the warmth that must have belonged
to Rebecca’s ideals and to her love for
Rosmer.</p>

<p>One may frankly admit, indeed, that Mrs.
Fiske’s acting does not please all tastes. What
some find to be her repressive force is in the
eyes of others “stilted awkwardness.” The
qualities which to most are her most salient
characteristics are to some her “intolerable
mannerisms.” One comment on her Hedda
was that there was “not a large or spontaneous
moment in it,” that it was “an adroitly articulated
mosaic, an assemblage of details, all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
precise exposition, rather than a jointless and
living whole.” Her personality has been described
as “cerebral” and “brittle,” and her
art as “too predominantly intellectual.” Attention
has been called to her “maddening rising
inflection,” and, with wearisome reiteration,
to what has been called her “unfortunate
mannerism of runningallthewordsofasentenceintooneanother.”
In this last criticism there
is a measure of justice, for at times her speech
has been disconcertingly rapid. There has
been improvement in this respect of late years,
however, and to those playgoers themselves
temperamentally adapted to enjoy her work,
her enunciation has been seldom indistinct, her
so-called awkwardness and mannerisms full of
significance, and her “cerebral” acting and
personality the means of true impersonation.</p>

<p><i>The Pillars of Society</i>, since it is a social
satire rather than an outright tragedy, afforded
Mrs. Fiske as Lona Hessel an opportunity for
brilliant comedy. It was a small part, too
small indeed to have bestowed on it her powers.
But she has never chosen plays for their “star
parts.” She made Lona a delightfully humorous,
honest-hearted woman, a masterpiece,
within its limits, of satiric comedy. Especially
fine was her acting during Bernick’s confession
to the mob. We have already seen how she sat
in one of her motionless silences, listening, in
her face the joy of victory—a joy that finally
expressed itself in “a little smothered sob of
triumphant love which no other American actress<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
could have invented, or could have executed.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Fiske’s skillful acting of the lighter
passages in <i>The Pillars of Society</i> gives point
to a contention of many of her admirers—that
she should oftener be seen in comedy. In the
two conspicuous instances of her ventures into
comedy—<i>Divorçons</i> and <i>The New York Idea</i>,
she has been strikingly successful. In Sardou’s
play she acted with “a refined abandon
that was positively captivating, making Cyprienne
deliciously capricious and delightfully
feminine.” <i>The New York Idea</i> William
Archer found to be “a social satire so largely
conceived and so vigorously executed that it
might take an honorable place in any dramatic
literature.” It is an example of high comedy,
the comedy “that smiles as it chastises.” The
title is explained in one of the lines: “Marry
for whim and leave the rest to the divorce court—that’s
the New York idea of marriage.” In
its lightness of mood and speech the play is a
comedy, yet in the author’s mind the underlying
interest is serious, his purpose being not
to make fun of or satirize true love, but to make
fun of and call attention to the frivolous, inconsequential
attitude toward marriage and divorce.
American playwrights have seldom attempted
the satirical high comedy of manners.
<i>The New York Idea</i>, with its spirited, delicately
pungent wit, is by all odds the best example so
far. Mrs. Fiske brought to bear on her part,
that of a wife whose love for her husband persisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
after divorce, a lightness and sureness of
touch that were a match for the play’s best
qualities. Her resources of changeful mood
happily expressed Cynthia Karslake’s high
bred reticence of sentiment and rather sophisticated
gayety.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p><i>Tess of the D’Urbervilles</i> was written by
Lorimer Stoddard within one week, but the result
was, in the opinion of William Dean
Howells, one of the great modern tragedies,
worthy to be ranked with Ibsen’s <i>Ghosts</i>. At
least Mr. Stoddard wrote a strong, truthful
play, in the main faithful to the novel by
Thomas Hardy that was its original. It was
felt at the time that the American stage had
risen for once to unaccustomed literary and
dramatic heights. The play was produced in
1897. It was as Tess that Mrs. Fiske fully
“arrived.” Of her most notable characters
only Nora in <i>A Doll’s House</i> had preceded.
Her abilities had been generally recognized but
until now play and part had never so fortunately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
aided her. She was not Thomas Hardy’s
Tess. It was futile to expect that she would
be, for the Tess of the book was simple, primitive,
impulsive, whereas Mrs. Fiske’s art was
always better adapted to reflection and complexity.
Such qualities she gave her Tess.
And naturally her smallness and blondness do
not at once suggest Hardy’s heroine. Yet her
work was enthusiastically praised. In spite of
her disadvantages, in this part, of person and
method, the keenness of her perception of <em>her</em>
Tess and the nervous force with which she imparted
that perception to the audience made a
deep impression. Ir moments like that in
which she discovers her husband to be ignorant
of her past life, or that of the return of the
supposed dead Angel Clare, her power of repressed
emotion was most effective. While actually
doing almost nothing, her horror and
amazement were strongly felt across the footlights.
The few sentences to her husband that
recall the years of waiting and disillusion, were
simply spoken but with the agony of Tess’s
pitiful tragedy. The play was at once successful,
and the admirers of Mrs. Fiske, who had
waited long for a suitable opportunity for her,
felt at last satisfied.</p>

<p>It is as Becky Sharp, in a play based on
Thackeray’s <i>Vanity Fair</i>, that Mrs. Fiske is
by many most gratefully remembered. The
author was Langdon Mitchell, who several
years later was to write for her <i>The New York
Idea</i>. <i>Vanity Fair</i> is of course an immensely<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
complicated study of all kinds of characters in
all sorts of relations. At first blush it does
not seem promising theatrical material. Mr.
Mitchell wisely did not attempt to produce a
“dramatization,” but selected the most dramatic
incidents of the book, took the bare plot
thence and wove about it, largely in his own
dialogue, a well-constructed play. The climax
is the scene of Lord Steyne’s visit to Rebecca,
with the unexpected arrival home of Rawdon
Crawley. This scene, played with consummate
skill by Maurice Barrymore as Rawdon, Tyrone
Power (and later George Arliss) as
Steyne, and Mrs. Fiske as Becky, was admittedly
one of the high water marks in the history
of American acting. The scene of the
Duchess of Richmond’s ball on the eve of
Waterloo, with the stage full of people at first
gay and thoughtless, and then in succession attentive,
doubtful, certain of danger, terror-struck,
was a masterpiece of complex and
thrilling illusion. Mrs. Fiske’s Becky is
thought by many her finest portrait. Here
was an opportunity for subtlety, for piquancy,
for brilliancy, for varying moods, for humor.
If the Steyne incident was the big moment of
the play there were a number of lesser ones.
In the half-comic, half-tragic scene in which
Becky wheedles out of Steyne money to pay
Rawdon’s debts, Mrs. Fiske was superb. In its
uniformly effective acting, its literary interest,
its legitimately spectacular appeal, and its success
as an experiment with the native dramatist,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
Becky Sharp stands strongly forth in any review
of Mrs. Fiske’s career.</p>

<p>In <i>Mary of Magdala</i> Mrs. Fiske ventured,
none too wisely, into the field of poetic Biblical
tragedy. Christ and his teachings, and the
greatest tragedy of all, form the substance of
the play. The stage management was imposing,
the production sumptuous and accurate.
Tyrone Power as Judas was a genuinely tragic
figure and in the strongest scene—that of the
temptation by the Roman who was seeking to
have Mary buy the safety of Jesus—Mrs.
Fiske showed great power. Yet the play was
superficial and often clumsy, the treatment of
its lofty theme incongruous, and Mrs. Fiske’s
acting in a measure disappointing. She lacks
the sensuous in her temperament and method,
and on the whole she lacked in this part sustained
power. She was hardly the Magdalene
of the Orient.</p>

<p>More surely within the sphere designated by
her large but specialized talents was <i>Leah
Kleschna</i>, a strong drama of the redemption of a
thief’s daughter by the influence of a man whose
house she attempted to rob. The narrative is
continuously and plausibly interesting, the incidents
of great dramatic effectiveness. The
play was “modulated melodrama”—an effort
to lift a story of striking incident and broadly
drawn emotions into the realm of reality. In
the light it throws on the nature of the thief,
its making and its possible breaking, the play
had its social bearing. The immediate popularity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
of <i>Leah Kleschna</i> was a hopeful sign to
those interested in the growth of a worthy native
drama. With some point it was asked
why the author had not placed the scene of his
play in America instead of Paris. Mr. McLellan
has not, perhaps, borne out the promise
of this one play, but it is interesting to note
how many of Mrs. Fiske’s later plays have been
of native writing. To be sure success has not
always been the result. With moderately
gratifying results she has played three one-act
plays of her own writing,—<i>The Rose</i>, <i>A Light
from St. Agnes</i>, and <i>The Eyes of the Heart</i>,
all written years before, besides a one-act play,
<i>Dolce</i>, by John Luther Long. <i>The New York
Idea</i> and <i>Salvation Nell</i> are both, of course,
absolutely American. After <i>Mrs. Bumpstead-Leigh</i>
and <i>The New Marriage</i>, both by Americans,
came <i>The High Road</i> by Edward Sheldon,
the young author of <i>Salvation Nell</i>. The
foreign-made plays, <i>Rosmersholm</i>, <i>Hannele</i>,
<i>The Pillars of Society</i> and <i>Lady Patricia</i> have
varied this programme, but it is plain that Mrs.
Fiske in her encouragement of the native dramatist
has been courageous and persistent to a
point that few of her rival managers have cared
to follow.</p>

<p>The most interesting instance is Mr. Sheldon.
While he was still a student in Harvard, his
<i>Salvation Nell</i> was accepted by Mrs. Fiske.
Produced in 1908, it made a curious impression.
Without the contour or substance of
sound, full-bodied drama, and largely depending<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
for its popular appeal on the faithfulness
of the scenes of the New York slums, the play
nevertheless showed the young author’s gift
for situation, and afforded Mrs. Fiske a part
well adapted to her gifts. This comment is almost
equally true of <i>The High Road</i>, of four
years later, which Mr. Sheldon does not call a
play at all. It is a “pilgrimage” in which
Mary Page is taken through nearly forty years
of her life, successively as a young New York
State country girl, the mistress of a rich young
artist, the awakening young idealist rebelling
as she matures, as the woman’s labor organizer,
and as the devoted wife of a distinguished
statesman. The play is not a great one, nor
even a big one, but it is firmly interesting and
the range of effect for Mrs. Fiske is obvious.</p>

<p>Praise for her steadfast desire to search out
native-made plays cannot be too strong, and
some of these ventures have been among her
unqualified successes, but many of her admirers
feel that Mrs. Fiske’s continued experimentation
with the newer school of American
dramatists should be modified—if modification
is necessary—to obtain the thorough-going effectiveness
of play, player and production she has
at times attained. Let us have more <i>Becky
Sharps</i> and <i>New York Ideas</i>, even if it must
be in revival.</p>

<p>One important factor in Mrs. Fiske’s success
has been only hinted. The married life
of people of the theatre has been a frequent
and sometimes justified cause for unpleasant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
comment. In the case of Mrs. Fiske much of
the success of the better known half of the
house has been to a degree due to her husband.
It is pleasant to record this fact—not that it
is a unique situation (for married stage folk
can be normally happy more readily than is
thought) but because Mr. Fiske’s share in his
wife’s productions has not been wholly understood.
In a recent letter which Mrs. Fiske distributed
to the press she gives to her husband
a generous share of the credit for the excellence
which has always marked the productions
of the Manhattan Company. To him is due,
she says, the taste and thoroughness of the settings.
The play which she was giving at the
time and which gave the announcement point,
was <i>The High Road</i>. The second act is placed
in an apartment in upper New York, furnished
by an artist of training and knowledge. The
scene bears this out in a way that strikes a
new note in stage decoration. The tapestries,
the reproductions of oil paintings, carved doors
and mantelpiece, the furniture, are accurate to
the last detail.</p>

<p>Mr. Fiske leased and managed the Manhattan
Theatre in New York for the few years beginning
in 1901. With this theatre as headquarters
the Fiskes waged vigorous war for
eight years against the so-called theatrical syndicate,
a combination of theatre owners and
producing managers which had for years been
acquiring the leases or ownership of most of
the theatres of the country. The Fiskes steadfastly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
held out against the dictates of this syndicate
as to their plans for tours, and preferred
not to become the property of a monopoly
which was operated primarily for its money
gains. When their continued resistance was
strengthened by other “independents,” the
trust made it increasingly difficult to find
theatres to play in. During her tour in 1904
in <i>Leah Kleschna</i> Mrs. Fiske in some cities
played in summer gardens, and on improvised
stages in halls, much as she used to do in the
old days of barnstorming. With the rise of a
rival syndicate, a rise made possible partly
through Mrs. Fiske’s help, the lines have
loosened and the Fiskes have no longer any
difficulty in “booking” their plays.</p>

<p>The Fiskes’ organization has become definitely
known as the Manhattan Company,
though they no longer control the theatre of that
name. “As a producer of plays” Madame Réjane
once said, “Mrs. Fiske has no superior in
Europe.” The uniformity of ability in the actors,
the adjustment of the characters which
often kept Mrs. Fiske herself in the background,
contrary to the usages of “stars,” the detailed
excellence of the stage “business” (as the ballroom
scene in <i>Becky Sharp</i>) have always given
the productions the interest, the appearance of
life itself. It is familiar knowledge among those
who have closely watched the American stage
that Mrs. Fiske is one of the best stage directors
of the time. The careful, extended rehearsal
of a play is hard work, but Mrs. Fiske,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
with the active nervous temperament that demands
hard work, is equal to it. She personally
directs the rehearsals of her companies,
and when one remembers <i>Mary of Magdala</i>,
for instance, which demanded a hundred actors
and was rehearsed more than six weeks, or
when one recollects the practically flawless
stage management of any Fiske production,
her merit as an imaginative producer becomes
apparent. Like her acting, her stage management
is quiet, effective, tensely alive.</p>

<p>During the retirement immediately following
her marriage, and since, Mrs. Fiske has found
time to write a number of plays. <i>A Light from
St. Agnes</i> is a one-act play of much dramatic
power telling a tragic story of low life among
the bayous of Louisiana. <i>The Rose</i> is another
one-act tragedy once played by Rosina Vokes’s
company. <i>The Eyes of the Heart</i> is likewise
a short play, having for its principal character
an old blind man who, after losing his fortune,
is kept in ignorance of his poverty by his family
and friends. All three of these pieces were
played at various times and with considerable
success by Mrs. Fiske and her company. She
wrote several other plays, some of them longer,
but none well known today. <i>John Doe</i> was a
dramatization of a sketch by Mr. Fiske; <i>Grandpapa</i>,
<i>Not Guilty</i> and <i>Common Clay</i> were all
long plays; <i>Fontenelle</i>, which she wrote with
Mr. Fiske, was played by James O’Neill;
<i>Countess Roudine</i> was written with the help of
Paul Kester and was once in the repertoire of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
Modjeska. <i>The Dream of Matthew Wayne</i>
was also written by Mrs. Fiske.</p>

<p>Mrs. Fiske has said that the life of an actor
is intolerably narrowed if he has no interests
outside the theatre. Such interests she has.
The strongest is her devotion to the welfare of
dumb animals. The trapping of fur bearers,
the cruel conditions in cattle trains, lack of
shelter on the ranges, bull-fights, vivisection,
all have had her for an enemy. Individual
cases of cruelty are constantly receiving relief
at her hands and to various allied causes her
money and time has been given generously.
She often makes addresses before meetings in
the interest of such reforms, and at such times
the actress is quite forgotten in the humane
woman.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p>The often discussed limitations of Mrs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
Fiske have always been said to include her
physical equipment. She is no Bernhardt or
Terry in stature. During most of her career
she has been slender, and there are dozens of
women on the stage who will never attain a
hundredth part of her compelling personal
power, who are nevertheless her superiors in
superficial beauty. The truth seems to be
that in her has been demonstrated again that
when the essentials of acting of a high order
are present, actual beauty is a comparatively
negligible factor. Nor can beauty, to a degree,
be denied her. Her face is, one might say, of
the Scandinavian type. Her hair always was
and still is, beautiful,—a reddish golden—radiantly
golden when dressed to advantage and
seen in the glow of the footlights. Her eyes
are, at a guess, gray (though even her intimate
friends disagree as to their precise color);
they are large and, as no one who has watched
their part in an impersonation need be told,
expressive. Some have complained that her
carriage is not graceful; but it has something
more and better than grace, for it has significance,
fittingness in every walk across the
stage, every pose. With more justice has
comment been made upon her enunciation,
which at times has been undeniably too rapid.
As for the voice itself, it is among her chief
means to her effects—wide-ranged and sensitive
to the mood. It is at one moment charged
with emotion, quivering or repressed, at another
hard as steel, and again simply matter of fact.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
The contrasts are of great, and probably nicely
calculated, effect.</p>

<p>The high-minded judgment which has enabled
Mrs. Fiske to select plays which never
have a false appeal, her freedom from that self-importance
which distorts the meaning of plays
for the sake of giving prominence to the
“star,” are indications of her qualities as a
woman. She has broad sympathies, enthusiasms
for affairs outside the theatre, and cherishes
no inflated notion as to her importance
other than as a woman of the theatre. In her
travels, or visiting other theatres, it is her
habit to be heavily veiled and altogether lacking
in the “theatrical.”<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> She is much more
nervous when addressing, <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">in sua persona</i>, a
small meeting in the interests of some humane
movement than when facing a theatre full of
people. On the other hand she has an unusually
keen sense of humor, and some of her best
bits of acting are said to be in impromptu efforts
called forth by some circumstance arising<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
within the “family” of her company.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> One
of her engaging traits is her complete freedom
from the spirit of rivalry and criticism that
sometimes characterizes actors. By those close
to her she is said never to speak ill of any one.
Indeed her acquaintance among other “stars”
is limited; while in the world outside the
theatre her friends are many and often distinguished.
It may not be uninteresting that
Mrs. Fiske, unlike many of her profession, likes
“playing one-night stands”; that she does not
weary of the endless travel of theatrical life;<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
that she is continually studying to perfect her
impersonations or to prepare for future work;
and that she has a playful dread of being referred
to as “intellectual.” That word, as
applied to Mrs. Fiske, has become hackneyed.</p>

<p>The warmest admirers of Mrs. Fiske will admit
her limitations. They will, indeed, be
grateful for them; for her physical and mental
equipment, while they withheld from her
certain ranges of drama, simply forbade the
adoption by her of the tissue of unrealities
which constitutes conventional acting. Without
either losing for a moment the sense of conditions
imposed by the theatre, or gaining her
effects by means of commonplaceness set baldly
on the stage, she has evolved an extraordinary
realism made up of truth to nature combined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
with a sense of theatric art so nicely adjusted
that even in its most telling moments it is the
art that conceals art. It is, in the last analysis,
a method that is the visible expression
of a rich nature. And by the unalterable fixity
of her high aims, the dignity and strength
of what she has tried to do, she has earned
the gratitude of all those who look forward to
an influential, high-minded American stage.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>In the spring of 1914 Mrs. Fiske revived <i>Mrs.
Bumpstead-Leigh</i>, and in it proved herself at the
height of her powers as an adroit <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>. At the
beginning of the season of 1914–15 she acted, in several
Middle Western cities, in a new play by John
Luther Long and Frank Stayton. <i>Lady Betty Martingale</i>
was an ambitious production that took her into
an unfamiliar field, and that promised to rival <i>Becky
Sharp</i> as a feast of acting and spectacle. It was a
“costume comedy,” with the London of the eighteenth
century as its setting. The play was unfortunately
lacking in substance and dramatic interest, and was
withdrawn after a brief career.</p></blockquote>

<h2 id="JULIA_MARLOWE">JULIA MARLOWE</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">None</span> of Julia Marlowe’s forebears was
identified with the theatre, and she was
turned toward the stage almost by accident.
When once her fate was determined, her abilities
and ambitions were nurtured with the care
and privacy given a prize-winning rose, and
she was offered then to the public almost full
blown. She was none of the wild flowers of the
stage—the Ellen Terrys and Minnie Madderns—that
grow into a recognized position so gradually
that they seem to have been there always.
In her sudden leap into public notice Julia Marlowe
was something of a parallel to Mary Anderson.
Miss Anderson never played anything
but “star” parts; nor did Miss Marlowe
when once she had called for recognition as a
grown-up actress. In her early ’teens, however,
years before her début, she had had more
than a glimpse of the stage.</p>

  <div class="caption">JULIA MARLOWE</div></div>

<p>Her real name was Sarah Frances Frost.
She was born in the little town of Caldbeck, in
Cumberlandshire, England, and was brought to
America when she was about five. Her family
settled in Kansas, but soon removed to Ohio,
living first in Portsmouth, and then, when
Fanny (as she was then called) was about
nine, in Cincinnati. There her father, who appears<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
to have been some sort of skilled mechanic,
died while she was still a child. Her
mother was married again to one Hess, the
proprietor of a small hotel, frequented by
stage people; but this circumstance seems not
to have been a determining factor in the young
girl’s career. Fanny, with her sister Annie,
was sent to the public school.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> One day,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> when
Fanny was thirteen, she came running home to
her mother, much excited. She had, she said,
a chance “to be an actress and make some
money.” Colonel Robert E. J. Miles, a successful
manager of the early eighties, was organizing
one of the numberless juvenile companies
that played Gilbert and Sullivan’s <i>Pinafore</i>
throughout the country. “He wanted
Fanny,” said her mother, “because she was
pretty, to play one of the small parts. Well,
I did not think much of the stage, and was
strongly opposed to having Fanny undertake
anything of the kind, but she persisted, and
finally so annoyed me that I partially gave my
consent. That was the beginning of it.”</p>

<p>During the season of 1880–1881, and the two
seasons following, the young actress was known
as Fanny Brough—her mother’s family name.
She was promoted from the chorus of <i>Pinafore</i>
to play Sir Joseph Porter, and she was, besides,
Suzanne in <i>The Chimes of Normandy</i>
and a page in <i>The Little Duke</i>. The significance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
of this first engagement lies chiefly in the
fact that the stage management of the company
was in the hands of Ada Dow, a sister-in-law
of Colonel Miles. This woman had been a
competent though inconspicuous actress, and
she was a good stage-director. In one of her
charges, moreover—Fanny Brough—she had
the discernment to see an actress of exceptional
promise. It was to Miss Dow that Fanny
Brough, renamed Julia Marlowe, was later to
owe her early-won position as an actress of
genuine attainments.</p>

<p>Her experience in operetta young Fanny
Brough followed by playing six weeks as little
Heinrich in one of the several <i>Rip van Winkle</i>
companies that sprang into being after Joseph
Jefferson’s success in the play. The Rip in
this instance was Robert McWade. Then came
Colonel Miles’ attempt to make a “star” of
Josephine Riley, in the season of 1882–1883.
In the company were Miss Dow and Fanny
Brough, who now, as Balthazar in <i>Romeo and
Juliet</i>, had her first Shakespearean part. She
also had the formidable duty, for one of her
years, of playing Maria in <i>Twelfth Night</i>.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<p>During these few years the possibilities for
greater things lying in the young actress must
have become more and more apparent to Colonel
Miles and Miss Dow. Soon after the venture
with Miss Riley, Fanny Brough disappeared
from the stage and was taken to New<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
York by Miss Dow, and there put through a
course of training such as few actresses ever
undergo.</p>

<p>Off the stage the young aspirant was a rather
awkward, self-conscious girl, of a serious turn
of mind, imaginative, and like the youthful
Mary Anderson, and many another, an enthusiast
in her admiration for Shakespeare. Years
afterward Julia Marlowe said that she could
remember no real childhood. She had gone to
no children’s parties, and had had no girl
friends. “The experiences which come to
growing children as part of their girl life came
to me only as part of my stage experience. The
first long dress I wore was not as a girl, but on
the stage as Myrene in <i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i>.”
“At this time,” says one account, “she
was a saucer-eyed, yellow skinned girl, of a
melancholic temperament, high-strung, eager,
restless, and unbearable to herself when unoccupied.
Her chief joy was to revel in the woes
of tragedy queens.”</p>

<p>Obviously this was raw material. That the
same girl a few years later stepped before the
public in the large Eastern cities and, if not at
once financially successful, almost at once was
recognized as a well-graced, promising actress,
says much not only for her native ability, but
also for the quality and thoroughness of the
training that took place in the interim.</p>

<p>Miss Dow<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> took an apartment on Thirty-sixth<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
Street and a house in Bayonne, New Jersey.
In these places—and especially at Bayonne—the
girl’s studies were prosecuted with the
greatest faithfulness for something over three
years. There is not the least doubt that Miss
Marlowe, during this period of tutelage, worked
hard to deserve her later success. Five parts<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a>
were selected from the “classic” repertoire of
the day and were studied assiduously. The
pupil learned the cardinal principle of leaving
no dramatic effort to chance,—of knowing a
part so thoroughly well that it can be rendered
with a confidence in all the gestures and tones
to be employed. So well indeed was this
groundwork laid that it probably had its lasting
effect on the actress’s art. It has been the
commonplace criticism of Miss Marlowe that
she lacks the note of spontaneity, that there is
evidence of premeditation in all she does.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
“One would not urge,” said the <i>Evening
Standard</i> when she went to London in 1907,
“that the outstanding feature of her art is that
it is art concealed.”</p>

<p>“I never needed the spur,” Miss Marlowe
has said of her days as Miss Dow’s pupil.
“The aim of my instructors should have been,
perhaps, to keep me from working too hard.
Nobody deluded me with the assurance that I
was a genius. Indeed the contrary impression
was steadfastly enforced, and I secretly decided
that I might make myself a genius if I
only worked hard enough.”</p>

<p>Besides the minute study of particular rôles,
her tasks included music, dancing, gymnastic
exercises, the history and literature of the
drama, and, under the teaching of a singing
master, much practice in voice development.
The utmost care was taken in matters of
carriage and “stage deportment.”<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<p>Miss Dow’s pupil endured the rigors of this
training until the spring of 1887. Now, it was
thought, the young actress was ready to bid
for the public’s notice. It was the fixed idea of
both the pupil and her teacher that she would
appear only as a “star” and only in “classic”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
plays. It was but natural that managers were
slow to place so much confidence in an untried
actress. Months passed, and no manager could
be found to take her at her own valuation.
What would have been considered by many a
good actress attractive offers she repeatedly
declined. Finally it was again Colonel Miles
who became her patron, as he had been years
before. A company was organized, and the
erstwhile Fanny Brough, bearing now her new
name, made a brief tour (April and May,
1887) in Connecticut, playing Parthenia, Galatea
and Pauline. The opening performance
was in New London on April 27. She played
<i>Ingomar</i>, and the next day’s local paper said
that she was a genius and would “yet wear a
crown of diamonds.” Pleasing as this praise
may have been to Miss Marlowe, the truth is
that the brief tour was insignificant, and that
not the slightest ripple was caused in the great
centers by her début in “the provinces.”</p>

<p>The real beginning of Julia Marlowe’s career
came the following October<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> when, still under
Colonel Miles’ management, she gave a single
matinée performance of <i>Ingomar</i> at the Bijou
Theatre in New York. “Every one but me,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
says Miss Dow, “had lost confidence in her.
Mr. Miles asked me in trembling tones if I realized
what it would mean if she were a failure.
Julia had been in such a state of fright for a
few days before the performance that she lost
her voice temporarily. When the curtain rose
on her début she talked so low for a time that
no one could hear her. Then I said from the
wings, ‘Julia, if you don’t speak up, I’ll come
out on the stage to you.’ She grew angry at
this, and from then on everything went
smoothly. At the end of the first act there was
a silence for a long enough time for her to get
to her dressing room. Then the house burst
into a storm of applause and she was called before
the curtain again and again.”</p>

<p>The town had paid her compliment of curiosity,
the critics were more enthusiastic than
could have been hoped, and the managers made
her various offers, which she consistently refused;
all of which constituted a successful
début for an actress new to important parts.
She was virtually beginning her career at the
top, in America’s theatrical capital,—a course
involving courage and a high-minded disregard
of the many short cuts to easily won material
rewards.</p>

<p>Julia Marlowe’s best publicity agent at this
time was Robert G. Ingersoll. The “great
agnostic” had been “managed,” in his lecture
tours, by Colonel Miles’ partner, and was prevailed
upon to see Miss Marlowe act. However
great and good a man he was, Colonel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
Ingersoll was not especially skilled as a dramatic
critic. Still, such was his influence that
his letters of extravagant praise, widely copied
in the press, did more than any other one thing
to fix her name in the public mind.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<p>In December of 1887 she followed the October
matinée by a week at the Star Theatre in
New York, playing Juliet and Viola as well as
Parthenia, without doing much either to add to
or detract from the earliest impression. And
then, after this week, came another term of discouraging
delay. There came renewed offers
of positions in support of other stars, or in
plays not to her liking. But she refused them,
and said she would play as a star, in the “classics,”
or not at all. Evidently the Miles contingent
about this time lost some of its enthusiasm,
for it seems that a six weeks’ tour that
took her as far as Cincinnati was financed
by a new backer, said to be a Sixth Avenue
restauranteur named Bristol. Success did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
yet alight on the Marlowe banner, however, and
Mr. Bristol lost his five thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Financial success, indeed, was slow in coming
to Miss Marlowe, a fact which may seem
curious to a public that of late years has been
accustomed to seeing the mere words “Julia
Marlowe” and later “Sothern and Marlowe”
sufficient to fill any theatre. The restauranteur—art
supported by oysters!—was followed in
his part of “backer” by the New York photographer
Falk, who with a supreme faith in
his star saw twenty-five thousand dollars slip
through his fingers before a change of management
and the growing reputation of Miss Marlowe
turned the tide.</p>

<p>It was in the fall of 1888 that the American
public began generally to be aware of the presence
on its stage of a new and beautiful actress.
Mr. Fred Stinson was now made Miss Marlowe’s
manager. He was more adroit than
his predecessors, and engaged for her support
an excellent company that included Charles
Barron, who had been leading man at the Boston
Museum, William Owen, an excellent
Shakespearean comedian, Robert Taber (who
later became Miss Marlowe’s husband), and
Mary Shaw. A week was spent in Washington,
and then another week in Brooklyn. C. M. S.
McLellan, writing in the New York <i>Press</i>
of November 25, 1888, refers to her as “Julia
Marlowe, a girl who played a number of parts
in Brooklyn last week.” “She has a tip-tilted
nose,” he goes on, “wide, imploring eyes, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
slender shape buoyant with health and youth,
a songful voice, and the accidental movements
of an innocent.... She is now an artiste,
in sweet embryo.... It is the apparent pliancy
of Julia Marlowe, both mental and physical,
which makes you admire her now. It
also makes you wonder what her fate is to
be.”</p>

<p>The first genuine triumph of her career came
to Miss Marlowe when she reached Boston.
Her week at the Hollis Street Theatre in December,
1888, was the first completely reassuring
experience of her career, for there, for the
first time, did she win the genuinely enthusiastic
response of public and critics. In Philadelphia,
too, and in Baltimore, and Chicago, she
found a cordial welcome. Her ambitions were
beginning to be realized, Miss Dow’s labors
justified, and Mr. Falk’s coffers were once more
filled.</p>

<p>A correspondent of the Boston <i>Herald</i>, writing
from Brooklyn in 1888, gives his impressions
of the rising “star”: “Anything more
unlike than this young girl off the stage [he
had been ‘an audience of one in assisting at
her Thanksgiving repast, which was hurriedly
swallowed between matinée and evening performances’]
and as the character she represents
before the footlights I have seldom seen.
It is as though she were two distinct individuals,
bearing absolutely no relation in manner,
face, figure, temperament or intelligence to
each other. Away from the footlights, and divested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
of the rôle she personates, Miss Marlowe
is a frank, girlish young woman, almost
awkward in her movements, and shy and retiring
to excess in manner and speech. There
are times when she seems almost plain and
again one is surprised into thinking her absolutely
beautiful.... She is not at all assertive;
on the contrary, she impresses one as a
person who would never force herself into any
prominence. This is Miss Marlowe off the
stage.</p>

<p>“On the stage? Well, I had a mental shock
when I saw her as Parthenia. It was like a
transformation scene, and so complete that I
almost failed to recognize the actress as the
same shy, unformed girl I had been chatting
with. Is she a great actress? Decidedly, no.
But I would wager a good deal that the day is
not far distant when she will be hailed as
such.”</p>

<p>Successful as she began now to be in other
cities, she did not at once win as much favor in
New York. It took her ten years to become as
popular in the metropolis as she was in “the
provinces.” Taking a general view of Miss
Marlowe’s career it would seem that her conquest
of New York coincided fairly accurately
with her modification of her early ideals as to
playing nothing but the “classic” parts, for,
lying between the period of which we have
been speaking and the later “Sothern and Marlowe”
campaign with Shakespeare, there were
some years (roughly from 1897 to 1904) when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
the “classics” were pretty well abandoned.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>The first change in the hitherto carefully
guarded repertory came in 1894, when she was
married to her “leading man,” Robert Taber.
With a self-subordination rare enough among
newly-fledged “stars” she saw herself taking,
at times, inferior and sometimes quite unsuited
parts in plays produced primarily for the sake
of Mr. Taber. The worst instance was <i>Henry
IV</i>, in which Mr. Taber was an admirable Hotspur
and Miss Marlowe a Prince Hal who was
hopelessly at variance with the ideal of the
part.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> At this time she was known as “Julia<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
Marlowe Taber,” but the change involved some
sacrifice, for, by 1894, the name “Julia Marlowe”
had a definite value and the public did
not respond enthusiastically to the new order
of things. It is a theatrical axiom that the
public does not like to see man and wife acting
together. One manager<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> brought suit because,
having contracted for “Julia Marlowe,”
he got “Mr. and Mrs. Robert Taber.” It has
been said that Frederick Stinson, the manager
who had labored for years to develop the
prestige that attached to Miss Marlowe’s name,
aged visibly when his work was so rapidly undone.</p>

<p>The artistic coalition that was thought would
be the result of the marriage turned out
a comparative failure. Unfortunately a personal
element that proved anything but helpful
entered the situation. Mr. Taber was a
skilled actor of a rather hard style—but the
printed criticisms of their productions often
brought more praise to Mrs. Taber than to him,—naturally
enough, as she was the better artist.
His resentment at his comparative artistic
failure went to such lengths that he quarreled
with his wife, and, after three seasons of married
joint-stardom they went their separate
ways: Taber to London to act with Irving,
and his wife, after a meeting in France, and
an ineffectual effort on her part to effect a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
reconciliation, to America to resume her career
as Julia Marlowe.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<p>A survey of the plays the Tabers gave together
from 1894 to 1897 does not show that
the public was warranted, from any lack of
their adherence to the Marlowe standard of
play, in withholding its former allegiance.
There was, to be sure, the mistake, <i>Henry IV</i>.
Mrs. Taber was, moreover, a comparative failure
as Mrs. Hardcastle and as Lydia Languish—for
her <em>forte</em> was not eighteenth century comedy—and
<i>Romola</i> afforded scarcely any opportunities
for her, while Mr. Taber’s Tito had a
great success. But all of these plays excepting
<i>Henry IV</i> were really incidental, and at different
times during these three years Mr. and Mrs.
Taber were playing a number of the old Julia
Marlowe successes: <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Twelfth
Night</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>, <i>Much Ado</i>, <i>Ingomar</i>,
<i>Pygmalion and Galatea</i>, <i>The Hunchback</i>, and
<i>The Lady of Lyons</i>.</p>

<p>It was not until 1897, when the separation
had taken place and Miss Marlowe had placed
herself under the management of C. B. Dillingham,
associated with Charles Frohman, that
her period of artistic eclipse, and of great commercial
prosperity, began. At the dictation
of her new management, she abandoned almost
altogether the heroines of poetic drama, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
began a seven-year term in the service of the
dramatized novel and the quickly forgotten
modern ephemeral play. <i>The Countess Valeska</i>,
<i>Colinette</i>, <i>Barbara Frietchie</i>, <i>When
Knighthood Was in Flower</i>, and <i>The Cavalier</i>
make rather a sorry showing when compared
with most of the list just given. She was made
at last a successful “star” in New York,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> but,
as John Corbin wrote at the close of this period
of eclipse, she was “mourned by the ‘road’ [i.e.,
the country outside New York] as the living
tomb of a youth of abundant promise.”</p>

<p>Of these plays of the interregnum it is curiously
true that those least entitled to serious
consideration as drama, <i>Barbara Frietchie</i> and
<i>When Knighthood Was in Flower</i>, were the
most successful in advancing Miss Marlowe to
the heights of popularity. <i>Colinette</i>—which
was adapted from a French play—and <i>The
Countess Valeska</i>—from the German—were
both justified as skillfully written romantic
dramas, of much strength and charm, if not of
permanent value. <i>Barbara Frietchie</i> and
<i>When Knighthood Was in Flower</i>, however,
were highly artificial, thin, pseudo-historical
dramas, one dealing with the heroine of Whittier’s
poem—the play was by the prolific Clyde
Fitch—and the other a fictional episode in the
life of Mary Tudor, the sister of Henry VIII.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
Miss Marlowe’s sincerest admirers deeply regretted
the time and energy she spent, year
after year, on these and like plays; but they
often asserted that her acting transformed and
beautified the material with which she worked.
As Colinette, according to Mr. Winter, she
“gave a performance of singular flexibility
and of exceptionally artistic grace, such as not
only pleases while passing but leaves in the
memory an ideal of noble and lovable womanhood,”—strong
and partial words, but indicative
of the glamour Miss Marlowe has thrown
over inferior plays. “Her utterance of Barbara’s
appeal to her father for her wounded
lover’s life,” says Mr. Winter of her acting in
Mr. Fitch’s play, “was spoken with exquisite
beauty, and her expression of the frenzy of
grief, on finding him dead, reached as great a
height as is possible to spoken pathos.”</p>

<p>As for <i>When Knighthood Was in Flower</i>, an
English critic later said: “There is a certain
lilt and go, a touch of nature among the fool’s
fabric of the melodrama, which set her far
above our steady practitioners in the same act
of sinking. And, above all, a sense of parody
pierced through words and actions, commenting
wittily on the nonsense of romance which
so many were so willing to take seriously. She
was a live thing; defiantly and gayly conscious
of every absurdity with which she indulged the
babyish tastes of one more public.”</p>

<p>All this playing in popular pieces of the day
involved a certain amount of additional training<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
for the work that was to come,—the third
and last period of Marlowe’s work,—the ten
years during which she and Edward Sothern
were “joint stars.” She brought to her new
work a variously experienced, thoroughly disciplined
art.</p>

<p>It sent something like a thrill through that
large part of the public interested in the theatre,
when it was announced, in the summer of
1904, that Julia Marlowe and E. H. Sothern
were to act together in Shakespeare. It was
felt that the actress was again coming into her
own.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<p>Some of her parts with Mr. Sothern were but
revivifications of heroines of her early career:
Juliet, Viola, Beatrice, Rosalind; others she attempted
for the first time during one or another
of these years from 1904 to 1914: Ophelia,
Katherine the Shrew, Lady Macbeth, and,
at the inauguration of the ill-fated New Theatre
in New York, Cleopatra in <i>Antony and
Cleopatra</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
The American public, whatever its expectations
in 1904, has since come to take a rather
complacent view of its privilege in seeing Miss
Marlowe and Mr. Sothern act Shakespeare
together. They have been financially extremely
successful. Several other attempts
during this period to popularize Shakespeare
in America (and some of them were “produced”
and acted in a manner to make them fit
rivals) have struggled through brief and only
moderately well supported existences; while
Sothern and Marlowe have gone on for the best
part of ten years, drawing crowded houses.
Yet many an old time playgoer, who has followed
Julia Marlowe’s career since its beginnings,
will tell you that nothing she has done
since has quite equaled, in the combined appeal
of its fresh youth, its varied beauty, and
its unforced poetic moods, the acting of the
Julia Marlowe of early days.</p>

<p>The summer of 1906 Miss Marlowe spent—as
she has many others—in Europe. One of
the places she visited was the birthplace of
Jeanne d’Arc, for she was contemplating the
production of Percy MacKaye’s play concerning
the Maid. When she returned to America,
she and Mr. Sothern dissolved their association
with the Frohman side of the theatrical house,
and went over to the Shuberts. There followed
the production of a group of plays new to her
experience, <i>John the Baptist</i>, by Sudermann, in
which she played Salome, <i>The Sunken Bell</i>, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
Hauptmann, a piece retained from Mr. Sothern’s
earlier repertoire, and <i>Jeanne d’Arc</i>.</p>

<p>It was with the last two plays, and with
<i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>,
<i>When Knighthood Was in Flower</i>, and <i>Twelfth
Night</i>, that Miss Marlowe ventured for the first
time to appear in London, in the spring of 1907.
The success of the Sothern and Marlowe engagement
at the Waldorf Theatre hung at first
in the balance, for the first play presented was
<i>The Sunken Bell</i>, which failed to appeal to
London. As for Miss Marlowe as Rautendelein,
she was dismissed by Mr. Walkley in <i>The
Times</i> as showing the grace and elfishness and
charm of the character; “but she was not,” he
continued, “exactly a frisky fairy.”</p>

<p>The tide turned with Miss Marlowe’s Viola,
and, somewhat to the surprise of his followers
at home, with Mr. Sothern’s Hamlet, which was
hailed as a distinguished achievement.</p>

<p>One English writer, Arthur Symons, quite
lost his head in admiration of the American
visitors. “We have not in our whole island,”
he wrote, “two actors capable of giving so serious,
so intelligent, so carefully finished, so
vital an interpretation of Shakespeare, or indeed
of rendering any form of poetic drama on
the stage.” Beerbohm Tree gave them a supper
at His Majesty’s; Mr. Asquith was there,
a prince or two, and, more to the point, a representative
group of England’s stage workers.
“There is danger,” said <i>The Evening Standard</i>
when she played Viola, “of our all becoming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
Marlowe worshipers if she goes on like
this.”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a></p>

<p>Though the London critics appraised Mr.
Sothern’s Hamlet higher than American reviewers
ever did, and though the newspaper
comment on each play was favorable, except on
<i>The Sunken Bell</i> and <i>When Knighthood Was in
Flower</i>, the London public did not attend in
great numbers.</p>

<p>Still, the English tour may be said to mark
the apex of the career of both artists. When
they returned home each was for a time again
an independent “star.” When the ambitiously
planned New Theatre, in New York,
opened its doors for what was fondly hoped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
would be the dawn of a new era in the American
theatre, Miss Marlowe and Mr. Sothern
were the leading members of a cast assembled
to perform <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>. The production
pleased neither public nor critics, and
it cannot be said that Miss Marlowe will be
remembered chiefly for her Cleopatra. Since
then “Sothern and Marlowe” have again carried
Shakespeare up and down the country.</p>

<p>Why is it that the public, loyal as it has been
to them, has taken their untiring campaign in
fostering the Shakespeare tradition so much as
a matter of course? Perhaps it is because
nearly everyone speaking English now takes
Shakespeare himself as a matter of course, to
be accepted, like starlight and the blessings of
a free government, with unenthusiastic complacence,
and because Miss Marlowe herself is
so utterly Shakespearean. For everything she
has done has had a Shakespearean tinge. “She
was so infinitely more charming [as Mary
Tudor] than the play justified her in being,”
someone once wrote. “She looked exactly as
she would have looked had the play been
Shakespeare’s.”</p>

<p>“Those of us who saw her as the Queen
Fiametta remember well how incongruously
like Hermione she looked and was. When Miss
Marlowe played Colombe in <i>Colombe’s Birthday</i>
she seemed to forget that she wasn’t playing
Rosalind. And even in Mr. Esmond’s distinctly
modern drama, <i>Fools of Nature</i>, Miss
Marlowe to more than one spectator suggested<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
the England of Shakespeare’s day oftener than
the England of to-day.”<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a> As for Shakespeare’s
plays themselves: Her Viola, both of
the early days and of the later period, was so
lovely an embodiment of the poet’s ideal that
he himself would have been satisfied with it;
her Juliet, her Beatrice, her Rosalind, all in
more or less degree, were filled with the peculiarly
Shakespearean spirit, the radiant sweetness
and vitality of his women.</p>

<p>There is abroad among the theatregoers of
America a peculiar, almost personal affection
for Miss Marlowe, which is not inconsistent
with the complacent feeling of which we have
spoken. There is about Marlowe none of the
overpowering sense of riding the whirlwind
that has accompanied Bernhardt in her royal
progresses about the planet; she has none of
the picturesque ebullience of a Terry, nor even
the specialized appeal of Maude Adams. She
has been a happy “combination of the poetically
ideal and the humanly real” that wins, for
a beautiful and skillful actress, a position in
the popular heart, even if it does not take her,
because of more or less extraneous characteristics,
into the front rank of “personages.”</p>

<p>Miss Marlowe, in her quoted utterances, has
occasionally thrown light on her attitude toward
her own work and toward her profession:</p>

<p>“I wish they wouldn’t confound me so much
with the parts I play and imagine I must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
playing my own emotions because I give the
part I am playing an air of reality.”</p>

<p>“It isn’t the rewards that one works for;<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
we work because we have to, because we can’t
stop. Except for a shallow or vain nature
there is nothing in the rewards of this profession
commensurate with its pains; but in the
very labor of it there’s joy, if you’re born to
know it, that nothing else can approximate for
you.”</p>

<p>Those who have known Miss Marlowe in her
own person say that the simplicity and the
good taste observable in her work as an actress
find a counterpart in her life off the stage. The
home she maintained for years at Highmount
in the Catskills was a quiet retreat where she
enjoyed the outdoors, her books, and the society
of a group of friends, most of whom were
not personages known to the theatergoing public.
Her liking for books, which is said to be
keen, induced her not only to carry about on her
travels hundreds of volumes, but at one time to
take up seriously the study of the mysteries of
bookbinding. One summer she spent in Germany,
taking lessons in that craft, and in her
library are a number of volumes, illuminated
and bound by her own hands. She sings a little,
plays the piano well, and has a well-grounded
musical knowledge. Unlike many
another successful actress—Mary Anderson,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
for instance—she retained her early strong
love for her profession.</p>

<p>“The rarest quality of Miss Marlowe’s art,”
says Elizabeth McCracken, one of Miss Marlowe’s
closest friends, with what is probably
true insight, “is its lovely youthfulness. Her
mirth is utterly young; at its gayest, it is tinged
by a certain wistful gravity. Her woe is
young, too; at its saddest, no drop of bitterness
stains it. Children instinctively accept her as
a kindred spirit, someone not so different from
themselves as most grown-ups.”</p>

<p>Add to this engaging youthfulness—another
name, perhaps, for her sense of poetry—her
dark and buoyant beauty, her rich voice that
lent its own music to Shakespeare’s, and you
have Julia Marlowe, not a genius, certainly, but
one of America’s gracious women, who has
brought beauty in many forms to the American
stage in a period when, but for her, it had been
sadly lacking.</p>

<h2 id="MAUDE_ADAMS">MAUDE ADAMS</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">To</span> say that she is the most valuable piece of
theatrical property in the country is a
brutally commercial way to speak of an artist;
but that is the familiar and true, if one-sided,
estimate of Maude Adams. From a small
career, notable in its way, as a child actress,
through a girlhood that had its struggles and
trials, to an early share of success and then
to an amazing degree of affectionate popularity,
a popularity far exceeding that of
greater artists, has been her record. The mere
announcement of her name, without respect to
the play she is acting, is enough to fill any
theatre in the United States. Her popularity
is such that it amounts almost to an unreasoning
worship. One can safely say that, among
the women, at least, of America there is an
unorganized Maude Adams cult. And whatever
the lack of proportion between this adulation
and the intrinsic artistic worth of her
achievements, it cannot be said that Miss
Adams’ popularity has been unfairly won.
She has let her acting—whatever its limitations—and
her variously expressed ambitions speak
for themselves, without Bernhardtian advertising.
The public knows her not at all except<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
as it sees her across the footlights. She is one
of the dignified women of the theatre.</p>

  <div class="caption">MAUDE ADAMS</div></div>

<p>Her mother, Annie Adams, an actress well
known to the passing generation of playgoers,
was descended collaterally from the Presidential
Adamses of Massachusetts. James Kiskadden,
the father of Maude Adams, “a man of
handsome masculinity,” at the time of his
daughter’s birth had come out of the Middle
West to practice in Salt Lake City his business
of banking.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> Annie Adams has been better
known as the mother of Maude Adams than
as an actress in her own right; nevertheless she
has had a long career as a capable actress.
When Maude was born in Salt Lake City, on
November 11, 1872, her mother was a member
of the local stock company.</p>

<p>The public had not long to wait for its first
glimpse of Maude Adams. When she was nine
months old she was taken one night to the theatre
where her mother was playing. According
to the custom of the day, the evening’s entertainment
ended with a short farce, this time
<i>The Lost Child</i>. In this piece a baby is carried
on and off the stage several times, to be finally
carried in on a platter and set down before its
distracted father. The baby used on this occasion
was only a month or so old, and, as might
have been expected, it began to howl lustily in
the midst of its travels about the stage. Just
at this moment Mrs. Adams, who was not playing
in the second piece, was about to leave the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
theatre, when the stage manager caught sight
of little Maude. Miss Adams’ début took place
instantly, for she was placed on the platter and
rushed onto the stage in place of the howling
child. As the latter was some eight months
the younger, the audience was treated to the
unusual spectacle of seeing a child take on
twenty pounds in a few minutes.</p>

<p>After a while the family moved to San Francisco.
From time to time the little Maude appeared
on the stage, although for the most part
she lived the life of the ordinary child. Her
glimpses of the life of the stage were probably
more than enough, however, to “bend the
twig.” Once her mother was supporting J. K.
Emmett in <i>Fritz in Ireland</i>. Mr. Emmet had
seen Maude and wished to have her play a
child’s rôle in this piece. Her father at first
demurred, as Maude was only five. The child
was eager to take the part, however, and was
finally allowed to do so.</p>

<p>After another interval of dolls and books,
she played, when about six, the child in <i>A Celebrated
Case</i>. She learned her small part so
well that she had ample leisure to memorize
most of the rest of the play. One man in the
company, it is said, was often in her debt for
swift and accurate prompting.</p>

<p>The rest of her childhood was divided between
school—the Presbyterian School for
Girls in Salt Lake City—and occasional appearances
on the stage. Her mother insisted
on the schooling, and Maude was bright enough<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
at her studies. But one cannot wonder that
the life of the stage had already enthralled the
little girl. At any rate she left her books on
occasion, to play such parts as Eva in <i>Uncle
Tom’s Cabin</i>, Paul in <i>The Octoroon</i>, and Oliver
Twist.</p>

<p>“Little Maudie Adams” came to be the
first choice for children’s parts in the best companies
playing along the Pacific coast. One
who saw much of her in those days, and who
took pains to give her much undoubtedly valuable
instruction, was David Belasco. “I was
the stage manager of the Baldwin<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> then,”
said Mr. Belasco. “James A. Herne and I
were playing there together, and in our plays
there was usually a child’s part. Annie Adams
I had known for some years as one of the
best character actresses of the West, but my
first remembrance of Maude Adams is of a spindle-legged
little girl, unusually thin and tall
for her age, with a funny little pigtail and one
of the quaintest little faces you ever saw. I
don’t think even her mother considered Maudie
pretty in those days. But even in her babyhood
there was a magnetism about the child,—some
traces of that wonderfully sweet and
charming personality which was to prove such
a tremendous advantage to her in the later
years.... She could act and grasp the meaning
of a part long before she was able to read.
When we were beginning rehearsals of a new<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
play I would take Maudie on my knee and bit
by bit would explain to her the meaning of the
part she had to play. I can see her now, with
her little spindle legs almost touching the floor,
her tiny face, none too clean, perhaps, peering
up into mine, and those wise eyes of hers drinking
in every word. I soon learned to know that
it was no use to confine myself to a description
of her own work: until I had told the whole story
of the play to Maudie, and treated her almost
as seriously as if she were our leading ‘star,’
she would pay no attention. She was serious-minded
in her own childish way even in those
days, and once she realized that you were treating
her seriously there was nothing that child
would not try to do.”<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>One of “Little Maudie’s” successes at this
time was in <i>Chums</i>, which Mr. Belasco had
adapted from an old English play <i>The Mariner’s
Compass</i>. Mr. Herne, who played in it
at the time, later made and acted in another
version, <i>The Hearts of Oak</i>. The character
Crystal (for whom Mr. Heme undoubtedly
named his daughter) occurs in both versions.
“From the time Maude Adams created the
rôle,” says Mr. Belasco, “it became one of the
most vital parts of the play. <i>Chums</i>, in short,
scored an immense success, and ‘Little Maudie’
for time being was the heroine of the town.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Adams had seen to it that Maude received
more of the ordinary schooling than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
sometimes falls to the lot of a child actress.
When she was thirteen, however, her schooling
was called complete. The girl had had her
taste of success and during her term at school
had dreamed of returning to the stage. She
told her mother: “It’s no use my studying any
more, mother.... I want to go on the stage
again, so that I may be with you.” But when
the attempt was made it proved to be not the
easiest thing in the world. As a child actress
of less than ten, she had found parts awaiting
her. As a young girl in her middle teens, parts
were much harder to find. She traveled about
with her mother, getting an occasional small
part, such as one of the old women in <i>Harbor
Lights</i>, or the Princess in <i>Monte Christo</i>. In
the meantime, she studied hard, absorbing her
mother’s instructions and learning many rôles.</p>

<p>When Miss Adams was just under sixteen she
and her mother crossed the country—in the
caste of the melodrama, <i>The Paymaster</i>,—to
try their fortunes in the Middle West and
finally in New York. Although it is on record
that she won “a great deal of praise for her
simplicity and beauty,” one can see, in the account
of her nightly “plunge into a tank of real
water,”<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> a far cry to her later distinction as
the interpreter of the subtleties of Barrie.</p>

<p>According to thrice-repeated tales, which her
mother has recently taken occasion to deny, it
was only after a discouraging period of waiting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
and of fruitless visits to managers, that Miss
Adams got her first opportunity, when <i>The
Paymaster</i> had run its course. A more tangible
tradition is to the effect that while awaiting
something better Miss Adams worked for a
while as a ballet girl.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> According to Mrs.
Adams, Maude had not long been in New York
when Daniel Frohman offered her a position in
the company supporting E. H. Sothern. Virginia
Harned took up the cause of the young actress,
and introduced her to Mr. Sothern. “I
must have been a strangely unattractive and
unclassified creature at the time,” says Miss
Adams, “too young for mature parts and too
old for child impersonations. Miss Harned,
who had played child parts with me, had succeeded
in interesting Mr. Sothern in me and
one great day I was invited to dine with them
in a public restaurant. I am sure that I disgusted
Mr. Sothern with my unconquerable
bashfulness and awkwardness. Painfully diffident,
I scarcely uttered a word during the
whole of that dinner. Nonetheless I was soon
afterward engaged to play in the Sothern company.”<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
The engagement with Sothern was brief,
however, like all that had gone before. Not
until she was given the part of Dot Bradbury
in Hoyt’s farce <i>A Midnight Bell</i> (in March
1889) did circumstances combine to give her a
good part, a long engagement, and some public
notice. Until now she was quite unknown to
the public at large. But she played this part
through the spring and all during the following
season. Discerning playgoers, and a critic
here and there, began to speak of her as one of
the promising youngsters of the stage, and
what was more important, she attracted the attention
of Charles Frohman, who in the fall of
1890 was organizing a stock company for the
Twenty-third Street Theatre. Mr. Frohman
gave Miss Adams a place in this company, and
from that day until his death—twenty-four
years—she remained under his management.</p>

<p>Her first part with Mr. Frohman was a small
one—Evangeline Bender in <i>All the Comforts
of Home</i>. She gave it some distinction, however,
and in her next part, in <i>Men and
Women</i>, she was watched with interest. That
Mr. Frohman’s choice of this new actress was
unfortunate, was the opinion of many. She
was small, thin, pale—quite the opposite of the
accepted type of stage beauty; but she acted
well enough, apparently, for soon she was playing
Nell, the crippled girl in <i>The Lost Paradise</i>.
The part called for one passage of
heightened emotion,—“a fierce little bit of
melodrama” that served to attract new notice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
to Miss Adams. “In an audience of seasoned
first-nighters and blasé fashionables there were
moist eyes and a surreptitious blowing of
noses when Maude Adams gave rein to that
tender pathos which is all her own,” says one
witness. “This wan, hopeless figure peering
wistfully from its shabby raincoat out upon
a life she could neither know nor understand
was a triumph of natural emotion simulated
with superb restraint.” Mr. Frohman
showed his new company not only to New York,
but sent it on long tours throughout the country.</p>

<p>So well did Miss Adams acquit herself in
these first two years with Mr. Frohman that in
1892, when John Drew left the company of
Augustin Daly after eighteen years’ service,
and became a “star,” he insisted on having her
as his leading woman. Mr. Frohman, his new
manager, had had in mind someone of more
established reputation, of more thoroughly
tried gifts. But Mr. Drew had his way, and
Miss Adams her first real opportunity. She
was surprisingly successful. The play was
<i>The Masked Ball</i>.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> Her part was a brilliant,
high-comedy rôle, demanding at once spirit and
subtlety. It was admitted that she did not look
the part, that there was something awkward
and boyish about her Suzanne Blondet. Yet
her intelligence, her fine voice, her charm, and
her sincerity in emotional passages won her
much warm praise. It was her difficult task in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
one passage of this play to act a woman who is
feigning intoxication. To make this tipsy scene
anything but disagreeable was a severe test for
a comparatively unknown woman, who at best
had much to do to win her audience. Win it
she did, however, for she was called a dozen
times before the curtain. <i>The Masked Ball</i> had
a successful career of a year and a half, and
Maude Adams, at its close, had pretty well established
herself. At less than twenty she was
a “leading woman,” the youngest of the day.</p>

<p>Miss Adams remained as John Drew’s principal
supporting actress for five seasons—from
the fall of 1892 to the spring of 1897.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p>The success of <i>The Masked Ball</i> was not repeated
at once, not until four years later, indeed,
when <i>Rosemary</i> gave both Mr. Drew and
Miss Adams excellent opportunities. In the
meantime she had had occasional small triumphs,
and only one approach to downright
failure—in <i>The Squire of Dames</i>. In this
play she had the part of a flippant, heartless
young society woman, and, truth to tell, she
didn’t do much with it. In the <i>Bauble Shop</i>,
however, she had had an opportunity for her
simplicity and pathos, while in <i>That Imprudent
Young Couple</i> she rose superior to the play,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
and prompted this criticism: “That Miss
Adams was able to interest her audience at all
last night was due entirely to the charm of her
own personality. Her work is still exceptional
in its daintiness and its simplicity.... She has
found the short cut from laughter into tears.
It is good to see that the remarkable success
that has come to this young actress has not
turned her head.”</p>

<p>As for <i>Rosemary</i>, the last play of the John
Drew-Maude Adams period, it is to be said that
it is one of the most charming of the many plays
of its gifted and long-laboring author, Louis
N. Parker. It is a pleasantly old-fashioned,
idyllic comedy of the England of Victoria’s accession,
and seems to have disclosed equally
Miss Adams’s gifts of comedy and of pathos;—a
play well suited to her middle period.</p>

<p>At this time James M. Barrie was in America.
He was planning the dramatization of his novel
<i>The Little Minister</i>. He saw Miss Adams as
Dorothy and marked her at once as the woman
to play his Lady Babbie. Mr. Frohman already
had half-formed plans for promoting her, and
the opportunity to play <i>The Little Minister</i> came
just at the right moment. Mr. Drew was deprived
of his popular leading woman, and on
September 13, 1897, at the Lafayette Square
Opera House in Washington (and two weeks
later at the Empire in New York) Maude
Adams was launched upon her career as a
“star.” The success of play and player was
immediate and great, for on this occasion began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
that combination of dramatist and actress—Barrie
and Maude Adams—that has proved so
singularly appealing,—not only in this play,
but in <i>Quality Street</i>, in <i>Peter Pan</i>, <i>What Every
Woman Knows</i>, and in <i>The Legend of Leonora</i>.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a></p>

<p>For three whole seasons Maude Adams
played Lady Babbie, the first season in New
York and then, until the spring of 1900, up and
down the whole country. It earned for her several
fortunes. The play is, as Mr. Winter<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> has
said, a “neat but inadequate paraphrase” of the
novel, and the character of Babbie has not the
substance and power of the Babbie of the book.
Relieved of the necessity for an emotional power
that is probably beyond her, Miss Adams was
left free to delight her audience with the waywardness
and sweetness of the new Babbie of
the play. Miss Adams gave the character a
peculiar other-worldly charm that seemed then
to have made its way to the stage for the first
time, and that lingers in the minds of many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
playgoers as the best remembered achievement
of her career. It is probably true that she had
even before had parts calling for more varied
and difficult work, but the popular success of
<i>The Little Minister</i> was one of the extraordinary
incidents in American theatrical annals.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

<p>To vary the task of repeating the same rôle
months on end, and (perhaps chiefly) to satisfy
her ambitions, Miss Adams essayed, in the
Spring of 1899, her first Shakespearean part,
Juliet in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. The result was
anything but a complete success, though her
thick-and-thin admirers professed themselves
pleased. William Faversham was Romeo, and
James K. Hackett, Mercutio. Miss Adams as
Juliet left much to be desired. She has a gracious,
elfish, quite individual charm; she has
winning humor and a quiet, directly appealing
power of pathos; she is the interpreter <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">par excellence</i>
of the delicate, touching whimsies of
Barrie; but she has not, or had not then, tragic
power. Juliet, it need not be said, demands a
large share of such power. Young as Shakespeare
represents her to be, she is a creature
of glamorous beauty and consuming passion.
Such Miss Adams could not make her. She
could and did make Juliet pleasantly and touchingly
girlish, a graceful, fragile, pathetic figure.
But <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> was not an artistic success<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
(though it was a financial one) and Miss
Adams speedily dropped the part. “I have not
done what I intended to do,” she honestly acknowledged.</p>

<p>But her next part was not, as one might have
expected, a return to the medium of her accepted
successes. It was even a step further
away. Bernhardt, in the spring of 1900, had
acted the Duke of Reichstadt in Rostand’s play
<i>L’Aiglon</i>. Reichstadt was the son of Napoleon
the Great and Marie Louise of Austria. The
play tells the story of his abortive attempt to
regain his father’s throne. Miss Adams, a few
months after Bernhardt’s production in Paris,
essayed the part in New York, of course in an
English version.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Like one part she had
played before, Juliet, and another she was to
play later, Chanticler, Reichstadt was too large
and exacting a part for her. Yet by reason of
her own physical characteristics she suggested
the weakness and effeminacy of the young
Duke, and in the lighter scenes she was pleasing
and satisfying. In the more serious scenes—and
there are two that require great acting in
the tempestuous strain: the Mirror Scene, in
which Reichstadt is shown by Metternich the
hopeless weakness of his character and the desperation
of his cause; and the scene on the battlefield
of Wagram, where “the eaglet” is
crushed by visions of his father’s ruthless career,—in
these scenes Miss Adams was interesting
and pathetic, but she hardly exhausted the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
possibilities.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> The production of <i>L’Aiglon</i>
could not, however, fail to add to her artistic
reputation and to her immense popularity, if
that were possible.</p>

<p>With <i>Quality Street</i>, a delightful, simple, sunshiny
play by Barrie in which she was the lovable
and thoroughly feminine Phœbe Throssell,
and in the far less attractive play <i>The Pretty
Sister of José</i>, in which she was a Spanish girl,
“of delicate, winning sensibility,”<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> Miss
Adams returned to the sort of acting which in
<i>The Little Minister</i> had made her name universally
known.</p>

<p>Never, however, before or since, has Miss
Adams’ popularity risen to such a pitch as it
did upon the production of <i>Peter Pan</i>. First
produced in 1905, it ran for three seasons, and
when Miss Adams revived it recently and took
it far and wide about the country it proved as
popular as ever. It may be, as Mr. Winter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
says, “immeasurably inferior, in fancy and satire,
to <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>.” But then, Mr.
Winter found it at times puerile and tedious,
and could discern nothing in it but a diversion
for children. <i>That</i> it certainly was, but the
children’s ages ran from four to fourscore. It
was a matter of common observation, even in
that supposed center of case-hardened worldliness,
New York, that the audiences were
largely of grown-ups, and that stock-brokers,
“tired business men,” and others who would
flee miles from the ordinary “children’s play,”
came not once, but thrice, a dozen times, in some
cases, to see the triumph of Peter over Captain
Hook. The elfin quality, the gracious charm
and warm-hearted humor of Miss Adams’ <i>Peter
Pan</i> may not have been sufficient to make it,
as a feat of acting, her most memorable
achievement; but play and player have won
their way into the public’s affections more
thoroughly than anything else she has done—more
even than <i>The Little Minister</i>.</p>

<p>In another Barrie play, <i>What Every Woman
Knows</i>—produced after the comparatively
short life of <i>The Jesters</i>, a romantic mediæval
play in which she displayed her familiar ability
without working any great advance or change—Miss
Adams accomplished what remains as
probably the most noteworthy acting, <em>as acting</em>,
of her career. She entered thoroughly into the
part of Maggie Wylie—the Scotch woman who,
while regaining, in a novel way, her errant husband,
demonstrates again “what every woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
knows,”—the dependence of mere man upon
woman. The play was a delightful instance of
Barrie’s gift for dressing human truths in
whimsical fancy; Miss Adams, in the well
chosen words of Mr. Winter, combined “goodness,
tenderness, magnanimity, pride, motherhood,
and pity with some little dash of tartness,—and
gave a performance which needed
only flexibility and more essential Scotch character
to make it as entirely enjoyable as it was
artistically consistent.”<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<p>When Maude Adams was announced as Mr.
Frohman’s choice for Chanticler in Rostand’s
barnyard drama of that name, there was much
plain-spoken wonder. It was felt by even her
most cordial well-wishers that her ambitions
and Mr. Frohman’s indulgence of them could
not well go further. Facetiously expressing
this feeling, <i>Life</i> announced that Mr. Frohman’s
next production would be Shakespeare’s tragedy
of <i>King Lear</i>, with Maude Adams in the
title part. Chanticler demands an actor of the
somewhat florid style, at least an actor skilled
in poetic speech. The “make-up” is as nearly
as possible the fac-simile of our old friend the
barnyard rooster, comb, tail feathers, spurs
and all. It can easily be seen that an elocutionist,
in such a part, is a necessity. It was generally
said that the single and obvious choice for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
Chanticler was Otis Skinner, who would indeed
have been ideal. Still, Miss Adams, somehow,
certainly escaped failure. She is fragile and a
woman, not a robust man; but her Chanticler
took on, through her intelligence and sincerity,
a share of the impressiveness that the part
needed, though one felt that Miss Adams could
have been spending her ability to better advantage.
The apparent perversity that has taken
a sweetly feminine, very American woman, of
limited powers but sure ability to delight within
her proper, modern field, and made her first a
heroine of Shakespearean tragedy, then a decadent,
disease-stricken youth, then a young
mediæval nobleman in masquerade, and later
the embodiment, several times life size, of a
rooster, has been one of the strange phenomena
of the recent American stage. The extenuating
circumstances are first that managers are always
more or less at a loss for good plays, particularly
for a strongly individualized actress;
and further that Miss Adams, greatly to her
credit, did nothing without casting over it at
least the glamour of a fine intelligence and an
admirable ambition.</p>

<p>A marvelous exhibition of what Miss Adams
and Mr. Frohman, when they put their heads
together, could do in the way of contrast to
Phœbe Throssell and Maggie Wylie, was the
production for a single performance in the
great Stadium at Harvard, one night in June,
1909, of Schiller’s <i>Maid of Orleans</i>. Miss
Adams had played <i>Twelfth Night</i> in Sanders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
Theatre one evening a year before. The <i>Maid
of Orleans</i> was an outgrowth of the earlier performance
and was undertaken at the suggestion
of the German department of Harvard. That
there were one hundred and fifty mounted
knights in full armor, one thousand men-at-arms,
two hundred citizens, one hundred and
fifty women and children, one hundred and
twenty musicians, and ninety singers, besides
sixty speaking parts, gives some idea of the
magnitude of this unique presentation. In the
coronation scene more than fifteen hundred persons
were on the improvised Stadium stage.
The cost of this single evening’s performance,
with its specially constructed scenery and long
preparation, was tremendous. And Maude
Adams planned and carried through the entire
proceeding. “This,” said one perhaps over-enthusiastic
spectator, “is the biggest thing
ever undertaken by any woman, except the one
she is representing.” And through it all Miss
Adams was playing the Maid, even to leading,
on a great white charger, the troops of France
in the battle charge. The spectacular effects—the
storm scene, the battle scene, the scene of
the coronation—were vastly impressive, though
the petite figure and delicate art of the principal
actress were often lost in the largeness of her
surroundings.</p>

<p>Maude Adams and James M. Barrie seem to
have been, artistically, born for each other. At
any rate, it is in his plays—<i>The Little Minister</i>,
<i>Quality Street</i>, <i>Peter Pan</i>, <i>What Every Woman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
Knows</i>,—that she has deservedly won her fame.
The latest in the list is <i>The Legend of Leonora</i>,
in which she has forsaken Chanticler’s feathers
and Peter Pan’s breeches once more to don petticoats.
It brings Miss Adams back to a doting
public in a part that gives rein to her old time
ability as a light <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>. That a portion
of this public is more or less shocked to see its
beloved Maude Adams playing the part of a
murderess—even though Leonora and her crime
are amiable unrealities—indicates the strongly
personal element in the popularity of the actress.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>This personal element has been introduced
into the Maude Adams worship solely across the
footlights. That is to say, the public knows
next to nothing of her as a human being except
as her personality is poured into and out of her
work. Out of a native shyness as well as out
of a desire to avoid publicity except as an actress,
she carries her self-effacement off the
stage to the last degree. She is never met at
social gatherings, she has never addressed
meetings or written magazine articles; she is
seldom seen on the streets or driving in the
park, and the occasions on which she has, in
many years, gone to any theatre as one of the
audience could be numbered on one’s fingers.
She dresses with the utmost quietness and with
small regard to current styles.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
But her shrinking from “the general” is, one
need hardly say, without trace of a sour attitude
toward the world. She is said to be chary
of personal friendships, but those who know her
best speak glowingly of her bountiful kindness.
She has, of course, made a great deal of money.
A considerable share of it has gone, unostentatiously,
to the relief of the needy. She is said
to have a list of pensioners:—old, destitute
players, or acquaintances of her early life.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>Miss Adams has always taken a keen interest
in the mechanical side of the theatre. More
than most actresses she knows the intricacies
and the artistry of scenery and lighting, and has
much to say of them when she is to appear in a
new part. She has, indeed, her own office in
the Empire Theatre building and there conducts<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
the many details of organizing a production.
In adoring a sweet and fragile woman her admirers
are likely to forget that Maude Adams is
a thoroughly trained woman of the theatre, of
tried executive ability.</p>

<p>The sweetness and simplicity of Maude
Adams herself and of her acting comes in part,
one is tempted to think, from her very real love
of nature. She has a New York home—and a
quiet retreat it is—but her real abiding place,
when her work permits, is at Sandygarth Farm
on Long Island, where she owns what may fairly
be called an estate. She has there her stables,
her kennels, her fields under cultivation, her
woods; and she knows the details of farming
only less well than the secrets of stagecraft.
She has, too, a bungalow in the Catskills. She
is fond of riding and of long walks in the country.
Books form an inevitable furnishing in
all three houses. She has given herself a good
schooling in French, and she is on more than
speaking terms with the philosophers and poets.
She likes foreign travel, and has made several
trips to Europe and the near East. She plays
well the piano and the harp and when opportunity
offers she goes to symphony concerts.
Altogether she is a serious-minded devotee of
the essential, the beautiful and the simple. She
is of course aware of her own great popularity.
But the feeling it inspires in her is said by her
friends to be one of humility and wonder. And
whatever her rank as an artist, she has sent
across the footlights her simplicity, her sense<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
of sweetness and light, to be a beneficent influence.
Her picture, cut from a magazine and
pinned to the wall of a ranch house in the far
West, or of a tenement in the slums of an Eastern
city, is a symbol of something good added
to American life.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 id="TODAY">SOME AMERICAN ACTRESSES
OF TODAY</h2>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">“There</span> is no great acting now,” the veteran
theatregoer will tell you. “The
day of the stars has passed.” He who remembers
vividly Charlotte Cushman, Edwin Booth
and Madame Janauschek feels that times have
changed indeed. And he is quite right. But
sometimes he is sure, with Mr. Winter, that they
have changed altogether for the worse. And
there he is wrong. If it seems true that with
the passing from our stage of Madame Modjeska,
Miss Rehan and Miss Marlowe the robes
of high priestess of our stage, to whom all the
people delight to burn incense, grace alone the
slender form of Miss Maude Adams, that fact
does not necessarily argue a lack of genius in
the artists that remain. We are, on the whole
fortunately, abolishing the rank of high priestess.</p>

<p>All the women, with one or two exceptions,
who are the subjects of the preceding chapters
have been out-and-out exponents of the star system.
It is an undesirable system, which is not
essential to the theatre and which is only a passing
phase, though it has lasted a matter of centuries,
and though we owe to it many names that
make illustrious the annals of the drama. It is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
undesirable because it subordinates the play,
which first and last should be “the thing,” to
the interpreter of the play, because it exercises
a vicious influence on playwrights who write to
clothe personalities rather than their own ideas,
and an equally vicious influence on actors who
think of plays primarily as opportunities for
histrionic exploits. “But,” some one says,
“did not Shakespeare himself write plays that
are obviously for stars?” Well, he certainly
wrote plays upon which starship has battened.
Like any other good plays, however, Shakespeare’s
plays are even better when the starship,
as such, is left out, as any one will testify who
has seen them acted without the extraneous element
that is symbolized by enormous type on
the play-bill.</p>

<p>To think of the theatre first of all in terms of
actors and actresses is, however, natural enough.
It is a popular way of looking at the theatre,
and it would be idle to expect its total disappearance.
And it would be ungrateful. Actors and
actresses are public servants and benefactors,
to whom recognition and praise are due. But
recognition is one thing; starship, with all its
adulations,—Bernhardtism,—is another. And
there are good reasons for thinking that other
aspects of the theatre are also becoming popular.</p>

<p>The early years of the twentieth century
have been a period of rapid development in the
theatre, a development marked by at least two
broad phenomena: first, the growing public<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
sense of the drama as an art, of which acting
is a component part, not the chief end; and,
secondly, the revolution in the technique of
stagecraft. To sum up the matter in a word,
the stage is struggling, rather blindly, to liberate
itself from the conventions that intervene
between audience and play. As an incident in
that liberation, the star system is on its way,
not to destruction, for the actor of genius will
always remain a compelling figure, but at least
to broad modification. Starless casts and repertory
companies have been plentiful enough
to indicate the beginnings of a strong, new
current.</p>

<p>Again, playwriting and acting, hand in hand,
have become more realistic, more subtle, more
psychological; there are far fewer opportunities
for broad effects than in the old days, there
is far less of the intense concentration of playwright
and audience on a single character and
a single actor or actress. It is probable that
even if a Bernhardt or a Duse or a Cushman
should spring up in our midst she would find
effective physical and psychological barriers to
an ascension to starship as those illustrious
women have known it.</p>

<p>Very briefly indicated, these are some of the
phases of the phenomenon that may easily be
mistaken by the cherisher of traditions as the
passing of first-rate acting. Though it is different
in tone and method, and leads less often
to extreme heights of public notice, acting to-day
succeeds as well in its adaptation to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
newer ideal of the primacy of the play as did the
older school in the exaltation of the actor.</p>

<p>It is a rather odd circumstance that while
the English stage is rich in its actors and comparatively
scantily supplied with excellent actresses,
the reverse is true in America, so far
as concerns the younger generation. Our civilization
seems to breed actresses thickly at
home, and to entice them from abroad. When
Edward Sothern, Otis Skinner, David Warfield,
Henry Miller, Robert Mantell, John Drew, William
Gillette and even Mr. Hackett, Mr. Faversham
and Mr. Daly shall have retired from the
stage, who is to help Ernest Glendinning and
the imported Mr. Lou-Tellegen maintain the
honors of their sex? But when Mrs. Fiske and
Maude Adams shall have followed Julia Marlowe
into retirement, there still will be, even if
Ethel Barrymore and Margaret Anglin should
regrettably have left the stage, a considerable
group of still younger actresses, none of whom
may ever achieve stardom as it was once practiced,
but each of whom fits with admirable
ability into the newer order of things.</p>

<p>Better than almost any one else, Miss Barrymore
represents the dangers of the star system.
The daughter of one of America’s best actors,
Maurice Barrymore,<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> and the niece of another,
John Drew, she was a marked victim from the
beginning. Charles Frohman made her a star
in 1900, when she was twenty-one. She had had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
a scant half dozen years of training in her
uncle’s company in America and in Henry Irving’s
company in England, and had not played
more than a dozen parts in all. She was made
a star simply on the strength of a pleasing personality,
intelligence, a pretty face, and a working
grasp of stage behavior.</p>

<p>During the next decade, playing in pieces like
<i>Captain Jinks of the Horse Marines</i>, <i>Cousin
Kate</i>, and <i>Sunday</i>, she attracted and held a loyal
public that liked to see her personality exploited
in those comparatively insignificant plays, just
as adoring theatregoers throng today to see
Billie Burke and Marie Doro, whatever the
slenderness and frothiness of the play. But
let Miss Barrymore, in an effort to be a real
actress, try her hand at submerging herself in
an un-Barrymorelike character, in a play of any
serious interest, and that adoring public was bewildered
and disappointed and remained away
from the theatre. Such are the fruits of thinking
of the theatre in terms of the actor.</p>

<p>But Miss Barrymore had it in her to be a
real actress. Once in a while, prompted by her
ambition, she would do something that her fond
followers would think was queer. Thus, during
this decade, from 1900 to 1910, in the midst
of her prosperous playing of popular pieces, she
acted at one time or another <i>Carrots</i>, a one-act
play from the French in which she gave a pathetic
picture of the boy-hero; then, at a single
plunge, Ibsen’s <i>A Doll’s House</i>; then <i>Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire</i>,
a play that Barrie wrote for Ellen<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
Terry, and in which Miss Barrymore, to the
consternation of her peculiar public, appeared
as a gray-haired matron; and finally <i>The Silver
Box</i>, an unrelievedly serious and honest play by
Galsworthy, in which she descended to the
depths by acting an ordinary scrub-woman.</p>

<p>Not all of these did Miss Barrymore play
signally well; her starship, limiting her to a
play or two per year, had simply not afforded
her the training to become the actress she has
since shown herself to be. But in these brief
experiments at least she was feeling her way
out of the entanglements of theatrical pettiness.</p>

<p>When Miss Barrymore, in January, 1910, appeared
in Pinero’s <i>Mid-Channel</i>, she had married
and become a mother. Whether the admirers
of her former girlish charm and slenderness
liked it or not, she was now inevitably a
deeper-natured and more mature woman and,
consequently, capable of deeper and better acting.
The fact was speedily proved in <i>Mid-Channel</i>.
The play is a grim tragedy of English
middle-class life, in which a fine-natured
wife, after a gradual course of unhappy, deteriorating
life with a selfish and sensual husband,
ends her problems with suicide;—surely
not one of the pretty Barrymore parts. “There
will be hosts of the ‘Barrymore public,’ no
doubt, who will feel that in <i>Mid-Channel</i> they
cannot laugh with her,” wrote Walter Prichard
Eaton. “But to some more thoughtful men and
women it is a source of rare satisfaction that
at last the promise of that lovely voice and expressive<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
face has been fulfilled, and you can
weep with her, suffer with her, understand
through the spell of her acting a little better the
sorrows and perplexities of our frail humanity.
In short, Miss Barrymore has become an actress....
Her many admirers, gathered in
force, who evidently knew more about her than
they cared about Pinero, were disposed to laugh
in the first act during the scenes of her bickerings.
But never after that did she allow them
to suppose for an instant that they were not
watching a serious and passionate study of a
woman’s tragedy.”</p>

<p>After <i>Mid-Channel</i>, Miss Barrymore had to be
considered as one of the artists of our stage, if
she and her managers could only agree to let her
remain so. She revived <i>Alice-Sit-by-the-Fire</i>,
and played it with far more feeling and a more
convincing sense of maternity than she had
shown before; she has played the insurgent wife
in Barrie’s one-act masterpiece, <i>The Twelve-Pound-Look</i>,
with a sure-handed mastery of the
ironic and subtle that belongs only to a finished
actress; she has, most recently of all, acted
Madame Okraska, in the dramatization of
<i>Tante</i>, with a keenness of insight into character
and a finesse that showed again how far she had
traveled since the days of <i>Captain Jinks</i>. Let
us hope that henceforth Miss Barrymore’s unquestioned
talent will not be allowed to expend
itself on unworthy material.</p>

<p>Next to Mrs. Fiske, the leading actress of our
contemporary stage is undoubtedly Margaret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
Anglin.<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> Her training has had a wider range,
and her artistry a more varied accomplishment,
than those of any other actress on our stage.
Born in Canada of a non-theatrical family, she
came to New York to study. She is one of our
few brilliant actresses who have come to the
stage by way of the dramatic schools. In 1894,
when she was eighteen, she was Madeline West
in Charles Frohman’s production of <i>Shenandoah</i>.
When she was twenty she was playing
Ophelia and Virginia in James O’Neill’s company,
and from that day to this she has been one
of America’s dependable and versatile stage artists.</p>

<p>A few years ago we thought of her as a powerful
emotional actress who had come through an
apprenticeship in barnstorming, and an early
recognition of merit as Roxane to Mansfield’s
Cyrano, to full measured achievement in <i>Mrs.
Dane’s Defence</i>, <i>The Great Divide</i>, and <i>The
Awakening of Helena Ritchie</i>,—with a large
number of plays and parts scattered in between.
But of late years she has broadened her art
and made secure her place among contemporary
actresses not only by plunging wholeheartedly
into a campaign in Shakespeare, but by ranging
even farther and acting the heroines of Greek
tragedy. Miss Anglin is as effective in comedy—witness
<i>Green Stockings</i> and <i>Lady Windermere’s
Fan</i> as recent instances, and her Lady<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
Eastney in <i>Mrs. Dane’s Defence</i> for an earlier
one—as she is in emotional rôles; she has acted
in Australia as well as in America; she was the
first artist to carry about the country a repertoire
of plays set in accordance with the ideals
of the new stagecraft; and as Mr. Eaton has
said, “as a stage manager she has succeeded
in reviving something of the atmosphere of good
breeding, of polite comedy, of perfect ensemble
and polish, which we associate with the memory
of Lester Wallack.” It is an ample, dignified
career, now happily at its height, of hard working
service to the art of the actress.</p>

<p>When in 1913 Miss Anglin made herself a
Shakespearean actress-manager, the size of her
repertoire, the general excellence of her interpretations,
and the revelation of the beauties of
the new stage art that signalized her performances
combined to give American theatregoers
a new idea of her ability and broadening ambition.
The plays were <i>The Taming of the
Shrew</i>, <i>Twelfth Night</i>, <i>As You Like It</i>, and <i>Antony
and Cleopatra</i>; the scenery in each case
was a beautiful example—by Livingston Platt—of
the imaginative revolt from old stage conventions
that has notably marked the last
decade; and Miss Anglin’s own women of
Shakespeare,—though her Cleopatra was a comparative
failure and was soon dropped from her
repertoire, and though her Viola was to a degree
lacking in high spirits—were charming and
technically admirable impersonations.</p>

<p>In the Greek Theatre of the University of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
California at Berkeley, Miss Anglin has acted
four of the classic dramas of ancient Greece,—the
<i>Antigone</i> and the <i>Electra</i> of Sophocles,
the <i>Iphigenia in Auris</i> and the <i>Medea</i> of Euripides.
Though her training and her speech
have always been primarily those of the modern
actress, she has revealed in these classic tragedies
a simplicity of method and an authority of
voice and presence that few actresses, either of
England or America, could equal. With Miss
Lillah McCarthy presenting so beautifully the
women of Greek tragedy at one end of the country,
and Miss Anglin at the other, the classics
have had a day of real, if brief, glory.</p>

<p>If the roster of American actresses is given
a cosmopolitan aspect by the inclusion of the
names of Edith Wynne Matthison, Martha Hedman,
Hedwig Reicher and Bertha Kalich, all of
whom lived many years in Europe, the most
striking example of all is Alla Nazimova.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
She was born in Russia, went to school in Switzerland,
studied the violin at Odessa, the drama
in Moscow, and after a few years’ apprenticeship
in her native land and a year at St. Petersburg,
she acted with Paul Orleneff’s company
(of course, in Russian) in London. Coming
then to America she played a season in Russian
with her compatriots; and then, in June, 1906,
having signed a contract to act in English in
November of the same year, she set herself to
the mastery of the new language, much as Modjeska<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
had done thirty years before. She kept
her word, and when the appointed time came
she acted <i>Hedda Gabler</i>, which she followed during
the next half-dozen years, with others of
Ibsen’s plays: <i>A Doll’s House</i>, <i>The Master
Builder</i>, <i>Little Eyolf</i>, as well as several other
plays, like <i>The Comet</i>, <i>The Marionettes</i>, and
<i>Bella Donna</i>, in none of which the actress possessed
the significance that marked her when
she confined herself to Ibsen.</p>

<p>To play first in an obscure hall on the lower
East Side, then in two or three scarcely less obscure
theatres, and then, a year and a half after
her unheralded arrival, to act in a new tongue
in one of New York’s leading theatres—it all
makes one of the most dramatic of careers. If,
however, Nazimova is “a tigress in the leash of
art,” as Julius Huneker called her, an artist
must hold the leash, or it becomes too much a
circus tigress, going through the expected tricks,
but in a cage of which she is always conscious.
Nazimova did us a real service in her vivid
impersonation of Ibsen’s heroines. Mrs. Fiske
apart, no one else has done much for Ibsen in
this country. But apparently she cannot go on
playing Ibsen profitably; her art, which “expresses
itself in a continual physical virtuosity
which startles and thrills,” does not find an outlet
in the sort of play English and American
dramatists are likely to write; and, as Mr. Ruhl
points out, “of late she has drifted far from her
simpler beginnings and over-accented the more
exotic side of her personality as if determined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
to ‘run it into the ground.’” Like another actress
of striking talent, Nance O’Neil, Madame
Nazimova is idle chiefly because she and the
dramatists seem unable to meet on a common
ground.</p>

<p>The case for the poetic actress is little better.
After acquiring in England a thorough grounding
in her profession, Edith Wynne Matthison<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a>
came to America in 1903 and played <i>Everyman</i>
with a dignity, a charm of voice and person, and
a poetic poignancy that made the fifteenth-century
“morality” forever memorable for any one
who saw it. After brief experiments with
Viola, Portia, and Kate Hardcastle, she returned
to England, and then, after dividing the
intervening years between her old home and her
new, she settled more or less permanently in
America in 1910, when she joined the company
of the New Theatre. She must be regarded as
of the American theatre.</p>

<p>Miss Matthison is preëminently a poetic actress.
Her moods and methods, her rich and
tender voice, her whole training and personality
fit her rarely for the realization of the heroines
of poetic drama. How truly this is not the age
of the poetic drama, however, is shown by the
short list of rôles—outside of Shakespeare’s
heroines—that Miss Matthison has had, at once
adapted to her and worthy of her talents. At the
New Theatre she played Sister Beatrice in Maeterlinck’s
play of that name, <i>The Piper</i>, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
Light in <i>The Blue Bird</i>. And the New Theatre
was not wholly a response to public taste; it was
largely an attempt to foster it. For the rest,
Miss Matthison’s American appearances (and
her English experience was similar) have been
distributed among many plays of many kinds,
some of them excellent, like <i>The Great Divide</i>
and <i>The Servant in the House</i>, but all of
them rather beside the point, so far as Miss
Matthison’s peculiar talent was concerned.
When she played, and beautifully played, Andromache
in Mr. Barker’s recent production of
<i>The Trojan Women</i>, she again came briefly into
her own.</p>

<p>If Miss Anglin and Miss Matthison almost
exhaust our list of first-rate poetic actresses
(now that Miss Marlowe has retired), the case
is far otherwise with the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédiennes</i>. There
are two, at least,—Grace George and Laura
Hope Crews,—who are practiced adepts, thoroughly
at home amid the subtleties of high
comedy.</p>

<p>The place of Miss George<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> among American
actresses is only partly indicated by the announcement
that she is to direct her own theatre
in New York. Though she merits that distinction,
it is one that is easily within the grasp of
the wife of William A. Brady. But it is indeed
something to be one of our few actresses
who are mistresses of comedy. Miss George
made her first appearance on the professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
stage (she had previously acted much as an
amateur) as long ago as 1894, but it was not
until 1907, when she acted Cyprienne in <i>Divorçons</i>,
that she disclosed her talent brought
to its fullness by long and varied training.
Playing with her in <i>Divorçons</i> was that excellent
actor, Frank Worthing, and the effect produced
by them remains one of the memorable
incidents of American acting.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> During the
dozen years that preceded <i>Divorçons</i> and again
during the period that has followed, Miss
George has been condemned to play in a long
succession of comparatively inferior plays.
The list is varied only occasionally by brief appearances
in genuine high comedy, such as her
Lady Teazle in <i>The School for Scandal</i> at the
New Theatre and her Beatrice in <i>Much Ado
About Nothing</i>. Taking it all in all, she is best
represented, so far, by her Cyprienne, an
admirable impersonation, compact with rich
humor, naturalness and charm,—and achievement
in real comedy. Miss George promises
to come into her own, however, with the opening
of the theatre in New York of which she is to
be the guiding spirit and the chief actress, for,
if promise fails not, it is to be a rigorously
guarded home of nothing but the best in the
realm of comedy.</p>

<p>Like Miss George, Laura Hope Crews<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> has
earned by long training and by brilliant accomplishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
the admiration she now wins.
She had been a child actress in the far West,
and, returning to the stage in her ’teens, had
undergone the rigorous training of stock company
work in San Francisco and New York for
a half dozen years before she attracted any
considerable notice. Such an experience in
American stock companies, with weekly changes
of bill, means either a sinking to a dead level
of mechanical acting, or a constantly enlarging
technical resource. The latter was the case
with Miss Crews. As Mr. Eaton has pointed
out, though she has come to be looked upon as
an actress of such sunny parts as Polly in <i>The
Great Divide</i>, and the whimsical heroine of <i>Her
Husband’s Wife</i>, it is because Miss Crews for
so long went from such plays as Hoyt’s <i>A Bunch
of Keys</i>, to others like <i>Magda</i> and <i>Hedda Gabler</i>
that she is today not merely an attractive
personality, but an actress of complete technical
equipment. Such she has again proved herself
to be by the finesse of her impersonation of the
wife in <i>The Phantom Rival</i>. By virtue of the
power of consistent impersonation which she
brings to bear upon her warmly human heroines,
her high spirits and her thoroughly trained resources
of humorous suggestion, she has earned
a high place as a <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">comédienne</i>; but the sincerity
and the variety of her art would equip her at a
moment’s notice to revert to the emotional heroines
of a more sober drama.</p>

<p>It is becoming too apparent that we have seen
the last of the charming and delicate art of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
Annie Russell; the physical power and the
emotional intensity of Nance O’Neil’s very real
talent find their expression only in plays of a
Bernhardtian type that to a great extent has
gone out of fashion on the American stage;
Rose Stahl, after a long career as America’s
best stock actress, leaped into international
fame by a single masterpiece of characterization
(in <i>The Chorus Lady</i>) which she has not
since had an occasion to duplicate; and the
charming and well-grounded acting ability of
Henrietta Crosman, always condemned to deal
with second-rate plays, seems to have run its
course, so far as the public is concerned.</p>

<p>To replace these and the other actresses<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> who
have dropped from the ranks of active service,
or who will, before many years pass, do so, there
is, as we have said, no lack of younger women.
A stage that can count upon Helen Ware, Margaret
Illington, Emma Dunn, Elsie Ferguson,
Emily Stevens, Frances Starr, Jane Cowl,
Martha Hedman, Doris Keane, Laurette Taylor,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
Irene Fenwick, and Florence Reed is suffering
no weakness on its distaff side. If only our accomplished
young actors were as numerous!
For each of these women is more than a mere
personality—she is a real actress, mistress of
the tools of her trade.</p>

<p>Like Miss Anglin, Margaret Illington learned
the rudiments of her art in a dramatic school.
Coming then from Chicago to New York, she
was immediately engaged by Daniel Frohman
for a part in <i>The Pride of Jennico</i>. That was
fifteen years ago, and it would be beside the
point to rank her with those who are, comparatively,
untried beginners. Miss Illington is a
practiced player with more than a score of excellent
impersonations to her credit; of which
Mrs. Leffingwell in <i>Mrs. Leffingwell’s Boots</i>,
Nina Jesson in <i>His House in Order</i>, Marie Voysin
in <i>The Thief</i>, Maggie Schultz in <i>Kindling</i>,
and Elinor Shale in <i>The Lie</i> are merely the outstanding
names. But she is still young and she
is one of those who can be counted on to carry
on the torch for years to come. “Miss Illington
leaves no delicate nuance of expression untouched,”
has been written of her. “She has
great vitality and physical beauty; she has a
perfectly secure and accurate dramatic instinct....
In two of the finest moments [of <i>The Lie</i>]
Miss Illington rises to tragic heights. In all
of the lighter scenes she is deliciously youthful
and piquant.... Fleeting glimpses of
humor and enfolding sweetness, and then the
big frantic outbursts of righteous anger and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
superb accusations.” In a part of quite
another sort, the harassed wife in <i>Kindling</i>,
Miss Illington “acted the ignorant, dumbly
struggling, desperate mother truly, simply,
touchingly.”</p>

<p>Miss Ferguson is a graduate of the musical
comedy chorus, and, for an actress who shows
so much ability, her dramatic training has been
brief. Only a half dozen rôles had followed her
chorus-girls days when she was given a part in
<i>Such a Little Queen</i>. She was not a star when
the play was produced, but not many days had
gone by when her managers boldly, and perhaps
prematurely, elevated her to starship. Her
beauty and intelligence went far to justify her
promotion, and when the pleasantries of <i>Such a
Little Queen</i> and <i>The First Lady of the Land</i>
were followed by the greater complexities of
<i>The Strange Woman</i> and <i>Outcast</i>, it became
plain that Miss Ferguson’s emotional truth and
sense of impersonation could be those of only a
genuine actress. The intellectual note that is
strong in her work, and the fluency, versatility
and certainty of the technique that she has
somehow acquired in her short career, make her
the most promising of our younger actresses.</p>

<p>Like Miss Ferguson, Miss Stevens is beautiful,
and alive to the finger-tips with the keen intelligence
of the modern American woman at her
best. Excellent training in her distinguished
cousin’s company she has followed by pleasing
performances of Emmy in <i>Septimus</i> and Anne
in <i>Man and Superman</i>, but of late the plays to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
which she has been assigned,—like <i>The Child</i>
and <i>The Garden of Paradise</i>, have failed so
lamentably that the light of her talent is in temporary
eclipse.</p>

<p>In Helen Ware, America has an actress who,
though her art, as so far revealed, is comparatively
limited in scope, is in the very first rank
of impersonators of highly-colored “character”
parts and of the masterful women of modern
melodrama. Her vivid gypsy girl in <i>The Road
to Yesterday</i> impressed American theatregoers
when she had been on the stage a half-dozen
years, and since then her work in <i>The Third
Degree</i>, <i>The Woman</i> and <i>Within The Law</i> have
more than reënforced that impression. She is
an utterly sincere actress, who plans and executes
her characterizations with admirable and
convincing consistency.</p>

<p>Emma Dunn’s succession of perfectly limned
stage portraits of elderly women; Frances
Starr’s achievements as Laura Murdock in
<i>The Easiest Way</i> and as Dorothy in <i>The
Case of Becky</i>; Jane Cowl’s Mary Turner
in <i>Within The Law</i>, an impersonation that took
Miss Cowl at a single bound almost to the side
of Helen Ware; the beautifully feminine and
intelligent acting—in an acquired tongue—of
Martha Hedman, who has come to us from Sweden;
the charmingly restrained and skillful
work of Florence Reed in <i>The Yellow Ticket</i>;
Doris Keane’s admirably lifelike and subtle impersonation
of a prima donna of the sixties in
<i>Romance</i>; Irene Fenwick’s vivid Lily Kardos<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
in <i>The Song of Songs</i>, and Laurette Taylor’s
exotic princess in <i>The Bird of Paradise</i>, and her
delightfully human, humorously pathetic, internationally
memorable Peg;—these have hardly
had time to become memories. Surely, so far
as actresses are concerned, our stage is richly
endowed. And not only with native talent.
Hedwig Reicher, of German birth and training
and an excellent actress of Ibsen’s heroines, and
Bertha Kalich, who was born in Austria and
acted in New York in Yiddish, have both adopted
America and the English tongue and, like Alla
Nazimova and Martha Hedman, must henceforth
be counted among America’s actresses.
Mimi Aguglia is living in our midst, and acts in
Italian when, all too rarely, opportunity presents
itself.</p>

<p>As for visitors from England, Marie Tempest,
Mrs. Patrick Campbell and Gertrude Elliott are
almost as familiarly known in this country as
at home; the girlish charm of Phyllis Neilson-Terry,
and the ample art of Lillah McCarthy,
who is equal alike to the exacting demands of
Greek tragedy and Shavian satire, it has recently
been the privilege of America to witness;
Mary Forbes is a newcomer, an actress skilled
in both poetic drama and realistic plays; and the
too rare visits of the Irish Players have given us
the pungent and stimulating art of Sara Allgood.</p>

<p>This chapter, or rather this list,—it could be
little more with so many ladies clamoring for
their deserved attention,—has at least made one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
thing clear. On the feminine side of the art of
acting, the only art in which women compete
with men on more than even terms, the American
stage is in a healthy condition. It has been
said, often with cynical emphasis, that in America
the audiences of women condition the whole
art of the drama. But it is not only at the box-office
that women outweigh the men in their
share in our theatre.</p>

<h2 id="APPENDIX">APPENDIX<br />

<span class="subhead">THE FIRST ENGLISH ACTRESSES, AND THE
CHANGE IN THE ACTOR’S SOCIAL
STATUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The actress, as an established element in the theatre,
is comparatively modern. The English stage
had been a flourishing public institution for something
more than a century when, in the first years of
the Restoration, veritable women began regularly to
replace those lads and beardless men who in Shakespeare’s
day enacted stage heroines.</p>

<p>There are, to be sure, fleeting glimpses of women
acting in England much earlier in the seventeenth
century, while boys were regularly playing women’s
parts. King James spent immense sums on his court
revels, and his Queen, Anne, was both actress and
manager—no doubt with much professional coaching.
In 1625—the first year of the reign of Charles I—there
was a merry round of plays acted at Hampton
Court at Christmas time. “The demoiselles,”—who,
as Doran surmises, were probably the maids of honor—“mean
to present a French pastoral wherein the
Queen is a principal actress.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Thus the first actresses
in England were amateurs, and among them
were two Queens of the Realm! Henrietta Maria
was, of course, French, and it was due to this fact,
and to her liking for the stage, that actresses from
France came to London<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a>—doubtless the first professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
actresses to appear there. The fashion—or
rather the obvious advantages—of the acting of
women’s parts by women appears to have commended
itself much earlier on the continent than in England.
“They have now,” contemptuously says Prynne,—the
author of <i>Histrio-Mastix</i> (1633) and the theatre’s
best hater,—“their female players in Italy and other
foreign parts.”<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<p>The French actresses who came to act at Blackfriars
may have pleased their countrywoman, the Queen.
But they seem to have had, on the whole, a rather
hard time. “Glad am I to say,” wrote Thomas
Brand, another stout Puritan, “they were hissed,
hooted, and pippin-pelted from the stage, so that I
do not think they will soon be ready to try the same
again.” Prynne was furiously abusive. He calls
the actresses by a variety of names, of which “monsters”
is one of the mildest.</p>

<p>But to some extent, the idea had taken root, and
during the ten years before the closing of the theatres,
in 1642, women occasionally replaced the boys and
men who passed for heroines. In <i>The Court Beggar</i>,
a play enacted in London in 1632, one of the characters,
Lady Strangelove, says: “The boy’s a pretty
actor, and his mother can play her part. The women
now are in great request.” These early actresses
were, however, not regularly employed, their names
have not come down to us, and it is correct to say<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
that professional English actresses appear for the first
time, when, in 1660, the theatres were reopened, after
their eighteen years’ suppression by the Puritans.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<p>There were two companies, Killigrew’s and D’Avenant’s.
Each had its regularly enrolled actresses,
whose names are recorded. Among them were Mrs.
Corey, Mrs. Hughes, Mrs. Knipp, the Marshall sisters,
Mrs. Davenport, Mrs. Saunderson, and, a little later,
Nell Gwynn.</p>

<p>No one, however, took the trouble to make certain
for posterity the name of the first of them to appear.
We know that she played Desdemona, in an adaptation
of <i>Othello</i>, called <i>The Moor of Venice</i>; that she
was of Killigrew’s company; that the date was December 8,
1660, and the place the Red Bull; and that
Thomas Jordan wrote for the occasion “A Prologue,
to introduce the first woman that came to act on our
stage.” But who the actress was is not known. Two
names are the likeliest: Margaret Hughes, and Anne
Marshall. Mrs. Hughes was “more remarkable for
her beauty than for her great ability.” “A mighty
pretty woman,” says Pepys of her, “and seems, but
is not, modest.” She was married later to Prince
Rupert, and brought him to the verge of bankruptcy.
Anne Marshall, the other chief claimant, was a competent
actress of the day, remarkable chiefly for being
the daughter of a prominent Presbyterian clergyman.</p>

<p>At first the old practice of giving the women’s parts
to boys threatened to survive, alongside the new custom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
of employing women. For a few years both
played the heroines, but the race of actors who could
portray women was fast dying out and, owing to a
changed public opinion, was not replenished.<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> When,
in 1663, the King granted patents to Killigrew and
D’Avenant, those managers were virtually instructed
to employ none but women to represent female characters:
“Whereas”—the royal patents read,—“the
women’s parts in plays have hitherto been acted by
men in the habits of women, at which some have taken
offense, we do give leave that for the time to come all
women’s parts be acted by women.” In a year or so
the “boy-actresses” had virtually disappeared from
the stage.</p>

<p>Our old friend Pepys had the pleasure,—undoubtedly
a keen one for him,—of seeing some of the earliest
appearances of actresses in London. We have it
from him that in 1661 he saw women acting in Beaumont
and Fletcher’s <i>Beggar’s Bush</i>. If he was present
at the Red Bull on the eighth of the previous
December, when the first English actress walked on,
he strangely omits to say so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
Something should be said of the changing conditions
in the actress’ calling since 1660. As we all
know, the complete social recognition of actors and
actresses is distinctly modern. Of course, in the nature
of things, they were always the objects of acclamation
and often admiration; but they were long in
attaining real public respect, strange as that seems to
an actor-worshiping (or especially actress-worshiping)
age.</p>

<p>There was plenty of historical background for the
old state of things. The ancients loved their theatre,
but their actors did not, as a rule, rank high in public
estimation. According to Cicero, at one time any
Roman who turned actor was disincorporated and unnaturalized
by order of the Censors; and Livy states
that players were not thought good enough for common
soldiers. The early Christians maintained the
same attitude, probably with better reason, for in
their day the drama fell into a parlous state. The
two councils of Arles excommunicated all players,
and in A. D. 424 another church council declared that
“the testimony of people of ill-reputation, of players,
and others of such scandalous employments, shall not
be admitted against any person.”</p>

<p>With the rise of the wonderful Elizabethan drama
in England the actors attained a measure of respect,
mixed, however, with a certain condescension.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Later<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
in the seventeenth century, when actresses began regularly
to appear on the English stage, the actor’s
standing was at least no better. William Mountford,
a respectable actor, one of the most accomplished of
his day, was killed in a street brawl by Lord Mohun
and Captain Hill, two dissolute “gentlemen,” who
were attempting to abduct the renowned actress, Anne
Bracegirdle. Mohun was tried in 1692 by the House
of Lords, and though he was flagrantly guilty, he was
acquitted, 69 to 14. During the hearing one nobleman
could not understand why so great a fuss should
be made about so small a matter and said that “after
all, the fellow was but a player, and players are
rogues.” And of the period immediately following,
John Fyvie says: “In the earlier part of the
eighteenth century anybody might insult an actor with
impunity; and if an actor were thrashed by a person
of quality neither he nor anybody else would have
dreamed that he had any right to retaliate.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<p>Dr. Johnson’s comments have been quoted as typifying
the attitude which even in Garrick’s day, a man
of intellect could maintain toward the player’s profession,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a>
though it is to be noted that not even in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
Doctor’s distinguished circle were his prejudices generally
shared. And Johnson himself, it will be remembered,
felt honored to receive a visit from the
celebrated Mrs. Siddons. “At all periods of his life,
Johnson used to talk contemptuously of players,”
says Boswell, “for which, perhaps there was formerly
too much reason from the licentious and dissolute
manners of those engaged in that profession. It is
but justice to add,” Boswell goes on, “that in our
own time such a change has taken place, that there is
no longer room for such an unfavorable distinction.”</p>

<p>A century had, indeed, seen a change. In 1660,
when actresses invaded the theatre, there was a long
road to travel before the actor could be thought of as
he is today,—innocent of social stigma until proved
guilty. It was then the other way about,—he belonged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
to an outcast class, until he proved himself deserving
of exceptional consideration.</p>

<p>Naturally, when women came to join the actors’
ranks, they shared more than to the full the social
disadvantages attaching to the calling, simply because
they <em>were</em> women; for, as is well known, it is a queer
twist of the ingrained chivalric attitude toward the
sex that when a woman ranges herself with men of a
doubtful class she is accorded a double portion of the
disfavor in which that class may be held. In any
event, the first century of English actresses saw them,
for the most part, doing their best to justify the
stigma. Anne Bracegirdle was notorious in her day,
not for lapses from virtue, but actually for leading a
measurably pure life. So singular, in her day, was
the actress who was not the mistress of some one her
social superior that virtuous “Bracey” was hailed as
a phenomenon. A number of lords and gentlemen
once met round a festive board and pledged a large
purse to be offered to her as a tribute to her rare
chastity.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> Her sister actresses, and many who were
to follow in the eighteenth century, were, in many
instances, openly the mistresses of lords and other
“fine gentlemen.” It seems superfluous to say of the
average nineteenth century actress that her standards
of life were, in general, far different from those of
her earlier sisters; and the fact is of much importance
in its direct bearing on one of the most interesting
changes that have occurred in the realm of the theatre:
the improvement in the social status of the actor
and actress.</p>

<p>For another cause of that change we may look to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
the general dramatic awakening that characterized
the latter part of the nineteenth century,—the vitalization
of the theatre as the home of an art worthy
the study and appreciation of the best minds. In 1660
and for many years later the English-speaking theatre,
at least, was not <em>that</em>.</p>

<p>Until fairly recent times the acting class was recruited
mainly from those who were either born to it
or who drifted into it more or less as a matter of
chance. Here, too, the nineteenth century saw a
change. Partly as a cause and partly as a result of
the improved social standing of the actor, ambitious
men and women of good family in increasing numbers
adopted the stage as a profession.</p>

<p>Again, the latter-day recognition of the stage found
a significant expression, in England, in the knighting
of a succession of distinguished actors and dramatists:
Henry Irving, Squire Bancroft, Arthur Wing
Pinero, John Hare, Charles Wyndham, George Alexander,
Herbert Beerbohm Tree, Johnston Forbes-Robertson.
In their own country, and, as one may
as well admit, in America too, the knighting of actors
could not fail further to dignify the calling.</p>

<p>All of these causes have acted and interacted,
through the years, to help bring the actor and the actress
to a point of public interest and esteem that is
reached by few of the world’s “authentic benefactors.”
Most important of all, however, as a cause of
their progress to something very like adulation has
been the increasingly strong position of the theatre
as the artistic meeting ground of all the people. The
drama of 1660 was the amusement of a restricted
class; now it is the universal art. Its skilled exponents,
affected by a strong general interest, cannot
fail to receive,—unless they willfully reject it—the respect
and admiration of their contemporaries.</p>

</p>
<p>
Some of the names in this list are, of course, among the
greatest in theatrical history. In Anne Bracegirdle and
Elizabeth Barry the Restoration rejoiced in two actresses of
the first order. “Bracey” was the Ada Rehan of her day, a
blithe creature of comedy who seems to have possessed the temperament
and the charms of the typical born actress. Cibber
called her “the <i>Cara</i>, the Darling of the Theatre.” She excelled
in the comedies of Congreve, but she was versatile, and
played also in tragedy. Elizabeth Barry was England’s first
great tragic actress. She was of the august, severe, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tragedienne</i>
type that was later exemplified in Siddons and Ristori,
and that has nowadays, with the decline of the poetic drama,
virtually disappeared. With these women, and with a number
of others,—some of whom, like Mrs. Betterton and Mrs.
Verbruggen, were skilled actresses,—the standard was surprisingly
early set high.
</p>
<p>
Anne Oldfield charmed the England of Addison and Steele
with a versatility and brilliance of acting that has never been
surpassed. She acted with great majesty and fire in the
tragedies of the day,—such as <i>Cato</i> and <i>The Distressed
Mother</i>,—while in comedy she “played with the enthusiasm of
a child.” There is much in the sunny amiability, the volatile,
zestful personality and the wide-ranged equipment of “Nance”
Oldfield to remind one of that modern actress,—Ellen Terry,—who
often herself impersonated Mistress Oldfield.
</p>
<p>
One thinks again of Terry in reading of Margaret Woffington.
“The Woffington” was a beauty, a hard worker, an
adept in comedy, and only less successful in tragedy. She
played captivatingly the rakish Sir Harry Wildair in Farquhar’s
<i>The Constant Couple</i>; she was notably good in parts
as diverse as Sylvia in <i>The Recruiting Officer</i> and Cordelia in
<i>Lear</i>; but the parallel to Ellen Terry appears when we read
of her lovely Portia and of her Rosalind (a part that Terry
was born to play, but somehow never tried). “Peg” Woffington
was one of that long line of geniuses with whom Ireland
has continued to enrich the English theatre, from her day and
Sheridan’s down to that of Ada Rehan, Bernard Shaw and
Synge.
</p>
<p>
Frances Abington, a person of temper and caprice, but a
true daughter of comedy nevertheless; Dora Jordan, who was
really two Dora Jordans,—“one the whimsical, hoydenish performer,
all laughter, or the delineator of graceful sentiment,—the
other, only seen off the stage, a shrewd little woman, of
kind heart and exquisite sensibility”; Mary Robinson, the
“Perdita” of him who was to be George IV of England, and
a graceful, appealing actress of the tenderly comic and of
such characters as Viola and Rosalind—the Julia Marlowe of
the eighteenth century; such are hints of a few of those
women who have continued the line of gifted actresses of
comedy and sentiment down from the days of Bracegirdle and
Oldfield.
</p>
<p>
For commanding figures in tragedy, for the Duses and
Bernhardts of earlier days, we must look, as a rule, outside
of England and America. There is, to be sure, always Sarah
Siddons, a majestic figure, a veritable Queen of Tragedy, who
made her characters—such as Lady Macbeth and Queen Katherine—awe-inspiring
even to those who acted with her. Her
niece, Frances Ann Kemble, was prevented from being a truly
great actress only by a dislike for the stage. As it was, with
her Juliet, her Belvidera in <i>Venice Preserved</i>, and her Julia
in <i>The Hunchback</i> she takes her place in that succession of
tragic actresses which, with the change in theatrical fashions,
has now ceased, and which has had its best examplars on the
Continent rather than in England.
</p>
<p>
In Charlotte Cushman, America produced a tragic actress
of commanding dignity and power. She was “a noble interpreter
of the noble minds of the past,” a stately and vigorous
woman, unique as Meg Merrilies, and a powerful and poetic
interpreter of Shakespeare’s tragic women.
</p>
<p>
The daughter of a Jew, Rachel Felix was a Parisian by
birth, and thus far she was an earlier Bernhardt. In the
thrilling intensity of her acting and in the capricious imperiousness
of her own nature, she again suggests Madame
Sarah. She introduced a measure of naturalness of speech
and spontaneity of action into the French theatre, and here
her influence was like that of Duse.
</p>
<p>
The rise of Adelaide Ristori spelled the decline of the
great Rachel. In her earnestness, in her choice of plays, in
the quiet dignity of her life and nature, Ristori is recalled
by that later great Italian, Duse. And just as Duse invaded
Paris and rivaled the reigning queen of the stage there, so
(only more successfully) did Ristori when she replaced
Rachel in French esteem. Ristori’s parts, however, suggest
rather Bernhardt, though in general all four actresses—Rachel,
Ristori, Bernhardt and Duse—have worked in the
same <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">metier</i>. Ristori’s great parts were Medea, Francesca,
Myrrha, Lady Macbeth, Phédre, Marie Stuart and Queen
Elizabeth.
</p>
<p>
Janauscheck, “the last of the actresses of the ‘grand
style,’” born in Prague and for years a successful <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">tragedienne</i>
in Germany, anticipated Modjeska by her adoption of
America and the English tongue. She too was an heroic
woman, who impressed her generation by the intensity and
sincerity of her acting, her wonderful voice, and the dignity
she lent her profession. Her best parts were in <i>Bleak House</i>,
<i>Brünnhilde</i>, <i>Medea</i> and <i>Marie Stuart</i>.
</p>
<p>
Adelaide Neilson, a womanly and gracious personality, an
ideal Juliet, and a Shakspearean actress who as Viola, Imogen
and Rosalind foreshadowed and combined many of the
merits of Modjeska, Rehan and Marlowe, died in the ripeness
of her youth and ability.</p></div>

“A brougham stops at a door; a woman, enveloped in furs,
jumps out, threads her way with a smile through the crowd
attracted by the jingling of the bell on the harness, and
mounts a winding stair; plunges into a room crowded with
flowers and heated like a hothouse, throws her little beribboned
handbag with its apparently inexhaustible contents into one
corner, and her bewinged hat into another, takes off her furs
and instantaneously dwindles into a mere scabbard of white
silk; rushes on to a dimly lighted stage and immediately puts
life into a whole crowd of listless, yawning, loitering folk;
dashes forward and back, inspiring every one with her own
feverish energy; goes into the prompter’s box, arranges her
scenes, points out the proper gesture and intonation, rises up
in wrath and insists on everything being done over again;
shouts with fury; sits down, smiles, drinks tea and begins to
rehearse her own part; draws tears from case-hardened actors
who thrust their enraptured heads out of the wings to watch
her; returns to her room, where the decorators are waiting,
demolishes their plans and reconstructs them; collapses, wipes
her brow with a lace handkerchief and thinks of fainting; suddenly
rushes up to the fifth floor, invades the premises of the
astonished <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">costumier</i>, rummages in the wardrobes, makes up a
costume, pleats and adjusts it; returns to her room and teaches
the <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">figurantes</i> how to dress their hair; has a piece read to her
while she makes bouquets; listens to hundreds of letters, weeps
over some tale of misfortune, and opens the inexhaustible little
chinking handbag; confers with an English <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">perruquier</i>; returns
to the stage to superintend the lighting of a scene, objurgates
the lamps and reduces the electrician to a state of temporary
insanity; sees a super who has blundered the day before, remembers
it, and overwhelms him with her indignation; returns
to her room for dinner; sits down to table, splendidly pale with
fatigue; ruminates her plans; eats with peals of Bohemian
laughter; has no time to finish; dresses for the evening performance
while the manager reports from the other side of a
curtain; acts with all her heart and soul; discusses business
between the acts; remains at the theatre after the performance,
and makes arrangements until three o’clock in the morning;
does not make up her mind to go until she sees her staff
respectfully endeavoring to keep awake; gets into her carriage;
huddles herself into her furs and anticipates the delights of
lying down and resting at last; bursts into laughing on
remembering that some one is waiting to read her a five-act
play; returns home, listens to the piece, becomes excited,
weeps, accepts it, finds she cannot sleep, and takes advantage
of the opportunity to study a part! This is the Sarah I
have always known. I never made the acquaintance of the
Sarah with the coffin and the alligators. The only Sarah I
know is the one who works. She is the greater.”—Edmond

insisted that I wanted to go away at once. In a gentle, tender,
caressing voice, but without any real affection, she said all
kinds of pretty things. She then went away. I could see
nothing but the dark, black hole which remained there immutable
behind me, and in a fit of despair I rushed out to my
aunt who was just getting into her carriage. After that I
knew nothing more. I had managed to escape from my poor
nurse and had fallen down on the pavement. I had broken my
arm in two places and injured my knee cap. I was two years

except ours, had been given bonbons on the occasion of the
baptism of the Prince Imperial, I proposed to several other
girls that we should run away, and I undertook to manage it.
Being on good terms with the sister in charge of the gate, I
went into her lodge and pretended to have a hole in my dress
under the armpit. To let her examine the hole I raised my
arms toward the cord communicating with the gate, and
whilst she was looking at my dress I pulled the cord, my
accomplices rushed out, and I followed them. Our entire stock
of provisions, ammunition, and sinews of war consisted of a
few clothes, three pieces of soap in a bag, and the sum of seven
francs fifty centimes in money. This was to take us to the
other end of the world! A search had to be made for us, and as
the good sisters could hardly undertake it, the police were
set on our track. There was not much difficulty in finding us,
as you may imagine. I was sent home in disgrace. On
another occasion, I had climbed on to the wall separating the
convent from the cemetery. A grand funeral was in progress
and the Bishop of Versailles was delivering an address. I
immediately began to gesticulate, shout and sing at the top
of my voice so as to interrupt the ceremony. You can imagine
the scene—a child of twelve sitting astride a wall, and a
bishop interrupted in the midst of a funeral oration! The
scandal was great.”—Huret.</p></div>

“after a formidable jump over a ditch which no one could jump,
and which my young cousin had dared me to attempt. I had
hurt my face, broken my wrist and was in pain all over.
While I was being carried home I exclaimed furiously: ‘Yes,
I would do it again, <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">quand-même</i>, if any one dared me again.
And I will always do what I want to all my life.’ In the evening
of that day, my aunt, who was grieved to see me in such
pain, asked me what would give me any pleasure. My poor
little body was all bandaged, but I jumped with joy at this, and
quite consoled I whispered in a coaxing way: ‘I should like
to have some writing paper with a motto of my own.’ My
mother asked me rather slyly what my motto was. I did not
answer for a minute, and then, as they were all waiting
quietly, I uttered such a furious ‘<i>Quand-même!</i>’ that my Aunt
Faure started back muttering: ‘What a terrible child!’”</p></div>

her début yesterday in the rôle of Iphigénie, is a tall, pretty
girl with a slender figure and a very pleasing expression.
The upper part of her face is remarkably beautiful. She
holds herself well, and her enunciation is perfectly clear.

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_17" href="#FNanchor_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> On the first night of Dumas’ play, the distinguished author
was the victim of a remarkable demonstration by the audience.
He sat in a box with “Oceana.” The novelist’s alliance with
this woman was evidently unpopular, for a great shout was
sent up and many in the audience were heard to call for the
woman’s removal. In the midst of the uproar the play,
already long delayed, was begun. The woman finally left the
house. The <i>Figaro</i> next day said: “Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt
appeared wearing an eccentric costume, which increased the
tumult, but her rich voice—that astonishing voice of hers—appealed
to the public, and she charmed them like a little
Orpheus.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_18" href="#FNanchor_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Now about five. Although she was a mother Sarah had

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_19" href="#FNanchor_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> Mme. Bernhardt tells a rather pretty story of the great
novelist: “One day when the rehearsal was over an hour
earlier than usual, I was waiting, my forehead pressed against
the window pane, for the arrival of Mme. Guérard, who was
coming to fetch me. I was gazing idly at the footpath
opposite, which is bounded by the Luxembourg railings.
Victor Hugo had just crossed the road and was about to walk
in. An old woman attracted his attention. She had just put
a heavy bundle of linen down on the ground and was wiping
her forehead, on which were great beads of perspiration. In
spite of the cold, her toothless mouth was half open, as she
was panting and her eyes had an expression of distressing
anxiety, as she looked at the wide road she had to cross, with
carriages and omnibuses passing each other. Victor Hugo
approached her, and after a short conversation, he drew a
piece of money from his pocket, handed it to her, then taking
off his hat he confided it to her and, with a quick movement
and a laughing face, lifted the bundle to his shoulder and
crossed the road, followed by the bewildered woman. The next
day I told the poet that I had witnessed his delicate, good
deed. ‘Oh,’ said Paul Maurice, ‘every day that dawns is a
day of kindness for him!’”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_20" href="#FNanchor_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> It was small enough, to be sure. Her demand was for
only 15,000 francs ($3,000) a year.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> It was on the occasion of the first night of this play that
she says she reverted to a trick of her childhood. Once when
she had been fed something disagreeable, Sarah deliberately
drank off a bottle of ink in the hope that she would die
and vex her mother. Now when Perrin refused her a month’s
needed holiday and forced her to play Zaïre in midsummer:
“I was determined to faint, determined to vomit blood,
determined to die, in order to enrage Perrin. Although the
rôle was easy, it required two or three shrieks which might
have provoked the vomiting of blood that frequently troubled
me at that time. I uttered my shrieks with real rage and
suffering, hoping to break something. But my surprise was
great when the curtain fell at the end of the piece, and I got
up quickly to answer to the call and salute the public without
languor, without fainting, ready to recommence the piece. I
had commenced the performance in such a state of weakness
that it was easy to predict that I should not finish the first
act without fainting. And I marked this performance with a
little white stone—for that day I learned that my vital force
was at the service of my intellect.” This is a significant
passage. It helps to explain the wonder of Bernhardt’s
unexampled vitality in the face of hard work and a frail
physique.</p></div>

quarter of a century earlier, Matthew Arnold had written of
Bernhardt, then in the midst of her first visit to London:
“One remark I will make, a remark suggested by the inevitable
comparison of Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt with Rachel.
One talks vaguely of genius, but I had never till now comprehended
how much of Rachel’s superiority was purely in
intellectual power, how eminently this power counts in the
actor’s art as in all art, how just is the instinct which led
the Greeks to mark with a high and severe stamp the Muses.
Temperament and quick intelligence, passion, nervous mobility,
grace, smile, voice, charm, poetry—Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt
has them all; one watches her with pleasure, with admiration,
and yet not without a secret disquietude. Something
is wanting, or, at least, not present in sufficient force;
something which alone can secure and fix her administration
of all the charming gifts which she has, can alone keep them
fresh, keep them sincere, save them from perils by caprice,
perils by mannerism; that something is high intellectual
power. It was here that Rachel was so great; she began, one
says to oneself, as one recalls her image and dwells upon it—she
began almost where Mlle. Sarah Bernhardt ends.”</p></div>

Patocka. On the occasion of Modjeska’s first visit to her,
“her judgment was just and most kind. She said she thought
I was unsuited to certain parts, but she was much pleased
with my romantic impersonations and also with some of the
characters in high comedy. She had seen Rachel and Ristori,
and told me I had neither their strong ringing voice nor their
tragic statuesque poses. ‘You see,’ said she, ‘they were born
with those gifts, and God created you differently. You have,
instead of those grand qualities, sensitiveness, intuition,
grace’; and then she added, laughingly, ‘You are as clever as
a snake. You played the other evening the Countess in <i>The
White Camelia</i> as if you were born among us. Where did you
meet countesses?’ I answered that she was the only great
lady I had ever laid eyes on. ‘You see,’ said she, ‘that was

Lawrence Barrett, at that time Booth’s manager, proposed her

of the opportunity to act with Mr. Booth, and played with
him in <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>Much Ado

and looked at everything, but I grew quite sad when I turned
my eyes toward the ocean. The blue waters of the great Pacific
reminded me of our first sea-voyage when we left our
country. The recollections of the happy past, spent among beloved
people,—Cracow, with its churches and monuments, the
kind friends waiting for our return, the stage, and the dear
public I left behind,—all came back to my mind, and I felt a
great acute pang of homesickness. I stepped away from the
rest, threw myself on the sand and sobbed and sobbed, mingling
my moans with those of the ocean, until, exhausted, I
had not one drop of tears left in my eyes. A sort of torpor
took the place of despair, and the world became a vast emptiness,
sad and without any charm.”</p></div>

I began at once a scene from <i>Adrienne</i>. I played it through

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> Her first appearance in New York was in <i>Adrienne
Lecouvreur</i>. The other plays of that season and the one following
were <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>; <i>Camille</i>; <i>Frou-Frou</i>; <i>Peg
Woffington</i> (in which she failed); and <i>East Lynne</i> (which
she heartily disliked).
</p>
<p>
<i>Adrienne Lecouvreur</i>, <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> and <i>Camille</i> were
for many years retained in her repertoire. Her appearances
in other plays were as follows: <i>Heartsease</i> (adaptation of
<i>Camille</i>), London, 1880; <i>Marie Stuart</i>, London, 1880; <i>Juana</i>,
(a failure, by W. G. Wills), London, 1881; <i>A Doll’s House</i>,
Warsaw, 1882; <i>Odette</i>, London, 1882; <i>As You Like It</i> and
<i>Twelfth Night</i>, New York, 1882; <i>Nadjezda</i> (by Maurice Barrymore),
1884; <i>Two Gentlemen of Verona</i>, <i>Cymbeline</i>, and
<i>Prince Zillah</i>, season of 1885–6; <i>Les Chouans</i>, <i>Measure for
Measure</i>, <i>Dona Diana</i>, and <i>Daniela</i>, 1886; with Edwin Booth,
<i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Much Ado about Nothing</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>Merchant of
Venice</i>, and <i>Richelieu</i>, 1889; <i>Countess Roudine</i> (by Paul
Kester and Minnie Maddern Fiske), and <i>Henry VIII</i>, 1892;
<i>The Tragic Mask</i>, 1893; <i>Magda</i>, 1894; <i>Mistress Betty Singleton</i>
(by Clyde Fitch), 1895; <i>Antony and Cleopatra</i>, 1898;
<i>The Ladies’ Battle</i>, 1900; <i>Marie Antoinette</i> (by Clinton
Stuart) and <i>King John</i>, 1900. In a letter furnishing some
of the above dates, Modjeska’s husband, who died in Cracow,
in March, 1914, wrote from Rzegocin, Posen, July 10,
1913:
</p>
<p>
“<i>The Tragic Mask</i> was written by Mr. E. Reynolds. It
was an original play, somewhat deficient in construction; but
the dialogue was very clever. <i>Daniela</i> was a translation
from a German play by Phillippi. The translators were
Hamilton Bell and Moritz von Sachs. As to <i>Les Chouans</i>:
This was an adaptation of Balzac’s novel of the same title,
made in French by the well-known actor and dramatist,
Pierre Berton, and translated by Paul Potter.
</p>
<p>
“In addition to the abovesaid repertoire it must be mentioned
that Madame Modjeska played <i>A Doll’s House</i> not
only in Poland, but also in America, in Louisville, in the
season of 1883–1884. This was, to my knowledge, the first
production of Ibsen on an English-speaking stage. Though
the part of Nora was considered in Poland, I think rightly,
one of Modjeska’s best ones, <i>A Doll’s House</i> did not appeal
then to the American public. According to local critics, and
especially to Henry Watterson, the audiences were not yet ripe
for Ibsen.
</p>
<p>
“Besides the plays you enumerated, Mme. Modjeska appeared
yet in a few others on special occasions. Thus, in the
spring of 1884, in Cincinnati at a dramatic festival, she
played Desdemona to Tom Keene’s Othello. In 1905 in Los
Angeles, she took part in a charitable performance and played
Hermione in <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, and in the summer of 1907
appeared equally for charity in a little French comedy entitled
<i>The Spark</i>. To be complete, I must yet mention a
short proverb by Hamilton Aide, produced in London in a
reception for the Prince of Wales in 1883, the name of which
has escaped my memory.
</p>
<p>
“But Mme. Modjeska did not play only in English in
America. She gave two consecutive performances in Chicago
in Polish for charitable purposes, supported by a company of
amateur workingmen. One was a comic part in a popular
peasant comedy, the other a tragic queen in a historical
drama. Twice also she played in French: once in 1884 in
London in a graceful proverb of Augier entitled <i>The Post-scriptum</i>;
she was supported by the above-named Pierre Berton.
The second time she acted in French in Los Angeles in
1907 for the ‘French Alliance’ in that beautiful one-act
drama <i>Le Pater</i>. As I mentioned her several charity performances,
I may be allowed to remark that Mme. Modjeska
rarely omitted an occasion to appear for charitable objects.
In January, 1909, about ten weeks before her end, already
then very weak and ill, she took part in a great benefit performance
for the victims of the Messina earthquake, in Los
Angeles, giving the sleepwalking scene of <i>Macbeth</i>.
</p>
<p>
“I will add that outside of the twelve Shakespearean
plays mentioned by you, and the two named above by me,
Madame Modjeska acted in Poland in two more—<i>Richard III</i>
and <i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>. Her repertoire on the Polish
stage known to me consisted of more than one hundred and
ten parts.”</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_69" href="#FNanchor_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> “During her long professional career, though Modjeska
was ‘presented’ by various managers, her personal representative
was her husband, Bozenta,—one of the kindest, most
intellectual, and most drolly eccentric men it has been my
fortune to know. Neither he nor his wife was judicious in
worldly matters, while—as is not unusual in such cases—both
thought themselves exceptionally shrewd and capable.
Their professional labors were abundantly remunerative, but,
being improvident and generous, they did not accumulate
wealth. The close of Modjeska’s life, contrasted with the
brilliancy of her career, was pathetic and forlorn. I called
on her, a few months before her death, in the refuge, a little
cottage, she had found, at East Newport. The great actress
greeted me with gentle kindness and presently, as though my
coming had reminded her of other days and scenes, she looked
about the small narrow room in which we were. ‘Ah, it ees
small,’ she said, ‘very small, this place of ours. But, what
of that? It ees large enough for two old people to sit in—and
<em>wait</em>.’ As I came away her lovely eyes were suffused
with tears. She looked at me long and fixedly. ‘Good-by,
my good friend,’ was all she said. She seemed to foresee that
it was our last parting.”—(William Winter, <i>The Wallet of
Time</i>.) It is not to be thought from this that Modjeska
died poor. Of the vast sum (said to be $800,000) that she
earned on the American stage, she left at her death something
over $100,000, in California real estate, stocks and
bonds, and jewelry. It is true, however, that she was lavishly
generous, and that her bounty was bestowed in many
places, private and public. She was the founder of an industrial
school for girls in Cracow, for which she gave
$100,000.</p></div>

a characteristic letter (September 26, 1887) to Clement Scott
she was emphatic enough: “Mr. Dutton Cook’s statement was
inaccurate, that’s all! I didn’t contradict it, although asked
to do so by my father at the time, for I thought it of little, if
of any interest. The very first time I ever appeared on any
stage was on the first night of <i>The Winter’s Tale</i>, at the
Princess’s Theatre, with dear Charles Kean. As for the young
princes,—them unfortunate little men, I never played—not
neither of them—there. What a cry about a little wool! It’s
flattering to be fussed about, but ‘Fax is Fax!’”</p></div>

with the great actor Macready. She accidentally jostled
him while running to her dressing-room. He smiled at her
apology, and said: “Never mind, you are a very polite little
girl, and you act very earnestly and speak very nicely.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_76" href="#FNanchor_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> Miss Terry relates the rise and fall of her childish vanity
at this time: “The parts we play influence our characters to
some extent, and Puck made me a bit of a romp. I grew
vain and rather ‘cocky,’ and it was just as well that during
the rehearsals for the Christmas pantomime in 1857, I was
tried for the part of the fairy Dragonetta and rejected. [The
children’s parts at the Princess’s were assigned after competitive
trials. For Mamillius “Nelly” had been chosen out
of half a dozen aspirants.] I believe that my failure was
principally due to the fact that I hadn’t flashing eyes and
raven hair—without which, as every one knows, no bad fairy
can hold up her head and respect herself.... Only the extreme
beauty of my dress as the maudlin ‘good fairy’ Golden-star,
consoled me. I used to think I looked beautiful in it.
I wore a trembling star in my forehead, too, which was enough
to upset any girl.” A little later: “I think my part in <i>Pizarro</i>
saw the last of my vanity. I was a worshiper of the sun and,
in a pink feather, pink swathings of muslin, and black arms,
I was again struck by my own beauty. I grew quite attached
to the looking glass which reflected that feather! Then suddenly
there came a change. <i>I began to see the whole thing.</i>
My attentive watching of other people began to bear fruit,
and the labor and perseverance, care and intelligence, which
had gone to make these enormous productions dawned on my
young mind. Up to this time I had loved acting because it
was great fun, but I had not loved the grind. After I began
to rehearse Prince Arthur in <i>King John</i>, I understood that if
I did not work I could not act! And I wanted to work. I
used to get up in the middle of the night and watch my gestures
in the glass. I used to try my voice and bring it up
and down in the right places. And all my vanity fell away
from me.”</p></div>

Sultan, Duke, Lord Tom Noddy, Lady Teazle, and so forth—and
as I was very proud of them as living birds, it was a
great wrench to kill one at all, to start with. It was the
murder of Sultan, not the killing of a chicken. However, at
last it was done, and Sultan deprived of his feathers, floured,
and trussed. I had no idea <em>how</em> this was all done, but I tried
to make him ‘sit up’ nicely like the chickens in the shops.

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Of her first night as Portia the <i>London Daily News</i> said:
“This is indeed the Portia that Shakespeare drew. The bold
innocence, the lively wit and quick intelligence, the grace and
elegance of manner, and all the youth and freshness of this
exquisite creation can rarely have been depicted in such harmonious
combination. Nor is this delightful actress less successful
in indicating the tenderness and depth of passion
which lie under that frolicsome exterior. Miss Terry’s figure,
at once graceful and commanding, and her singularly sweet
and expressive countenance, doubtless aid her much; but this
performance is essentially artistic, ... in the style of art
which cannot be taught.”</p></div>

of her admirers: “I have sometimes wondered,” she wrote,
“what I should have accomplished without Henry Irving. I
might have had ‘bigger’ parts but it doesn’t follow that they
would have been better ones, and if they had been written by
contemporary dramatists my success would have been less

noon on Monday placed herself and her campstool outside the
entrance to the theatre. The performance was not scheduled
to begin until the next day at half past one. During Monday
afternoon and evening the gathering outside the doors steadily
increased in size, until, at midnight there were many hundreds.
Miss Terry, late Monday night, appeared to greet the
waiting enthusiasts, and Mr. Arthur Collins, the manager of
Drury Lane, furnished them a supper of hot coffee, rolls and
cake. When the doors were at last opened many of those who
had thus patiently waited failed to find room within the
theatre. The proceeds of this entertainment, together with
those of a popular subscription in England and America, went
to Miss Terry and amounted to about forty thousand dollars.</p></div>

the minds of Americans were attested by various testimonials.
She was given at a special ceremony the Founder’s Medal of
the now extinct New Theatre in New York, a “farewell banquet”
was tendered her there, and in both New York and Boston
she received an elaborate “book of welcome,” signed by
many notable people and accompanied by poetic addresses,
composed in one case by Percy MacKaye and in the other by
Josephine Preston Peabody.</p></div>

as the Abbess in two performances of <i>Paphnutius</i>, a play
written in the tenth century by Hroswitha, a Benedictine
nun. It was on this old play that Anatole France founded
his romance <i>Thaïs</i>. Thus did Ellen Terry, at nearly three
score and ten, continue to furnish proof of her still youthful
spirit and readiness for work. Later in the year she went to
Australia to give there her Shakspearean lecture-readings.
The great European war broke out, and conditions in Australia
became so unfavorable that Miss Terry sailed for the
United States, where she again lectured in a few of the larger
cities.

For some years she had had increasing trouble with her
eyes. Frequently she would spend the periods between the
scenes in a darkened room. On February 23, 1914, in New
York, Miss Terry underwent an operation, which proved successful,
for the removal of a cataract from her right eye. In
June, 1915, she reappeared in London on the occasion of a
matinee given at the Haymarket in aid of one of the war
charities. The play—a ballet pantomime called <i>The Princess
and the Pea</i>—was the first musical piece in which Miss Terry
ever took part. On this occasion also her two grandchildren

pouted for a kiss, but with a lingering, or a dawning, suggestion
of irony. Moreover, she is exactly the reigning type,
the type that one meets constantly on the Paris pavements

met at the home of Dumas, at Marly. When she found herself
in the room with the man she had long venerated, she
was speechless with emotion, and, the accounts say, burst into
tears. When she finally acted in Paris, in 1897, Dumas was
dead. She acted there on the occasion of the great testimonial
to his memory. See page <a href="#Page_188">188</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_111" href="#FNanchor_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> In the last edition of his plays Dumas appends a footnote
to <i>La Princesse de Bagdad</i>: “There is in the last scene
a stage direction that is not found in other editions. After
having said to her husband: ‘I am innocent, I swear it to you,
I swear it to you,’ Leonetta, seeing him incredulous, places
her hand on the head of her son and says a third time, ‘I
swear it to you!’ This gesture, so noble and convincing, was
not used in Paris. Neither Mlle. Croizette nor I thought of
it; none the less, it was irrefutable and irresistible. Inflection
alone, however powerful, was not enough.” As a matter
of fact, until Duse introduced this bit of “business” no one
had ever been able to make the scene convincing, and as the
success of the whole play hangs on this scene, <i>La Princesse de
Bagdad</i> had always been a comparative failure. Dumas goes
on to pay tribute to Duse for introducing his work into Italy,
and in conclusion says: “It is to be regretted for our art that
this extraordinary actress is not French.”</p></div>

and brilliant,” Duse’s audiences during her first American
tour were generally not large in numbers. They were, however,
drawn from a discriminating part of the public, the
part that regards the drama as an art and goes to the theatre
only when its own high standards are likely to be met. During
the 1896 tour she attracted the same discerning public,
but also, this time, that other public which runs to fads.
“La Duse” became something of a fad, but happily at no
sacrifice of the quality of her acting.</p></div>

Française</i>, and Duse’s swoon in <i>La Dame aux Camélias</i>. So

Duse, different as the two are in many ways. There is in
each, in the first place, the same service to an art of an exceptional
intellect, the same high minded devotion to ideals.
Each has been a mistress of the subtleties, both of conceptions
of characters and of means to set those conceptions forth.
Each depends on the significant repression of emotion, rather
than on expansive exposition of emotion. Each is, in spite
of a fundamental seriousness, expert in comedy. Coming to
details, each depends largely on rapidity of utterance, with
occasional arbitrary pauses. Of the former—in a possible
excess—Mrs. Fiske has been sufficiently charged; the latter
Duse has been sometimes accused of carrying to undue lengths.
Finally each has her wholesome distaste for eccentricities and
meritricious publicity. Mrs. Fiske is Duse translated into
American.</p></div>

publishing to the world that she had confessed a dislike of
America. The report was widely spread, but the fact was
that Duse did not make the statement.
</p>
<p>
Her Magda gave a new revelation of her skill. “In suggesting
the social standing of the returned prodigal, Mme.
Duse takes a middle course between the frank Bohemianism
of Bernhardt and the loftier aristocratic air adopted by
Modjeska. It is interesting to note how she emphasizes
the theatrical nature of Magda’s past life, by just those
little exaggerations of pose and gesture common to nearly
all stage performers, but from which she herself, in ordinary
conditions is almost ideally free. These manifestations
of self-consciousness are confined to the second act, and
vanish when the inner self of the woman is brought to the
surface by the influence of powerful emotions.”—<i>The Critic</i>,
March 7, 1896. An instance, this, of Duse’s remarkable subtlety
in acting. At the point where Magda drives her former
lover from her presence, she “easily reached and maintained
herself at a height of emotion which can only be described
as tragic, and she wrought the effect without exposing herself,
even for an instant, to the charge of exaggeration or
rant.” Of this scene William Archer, a little later, said that
until he saw it he did not fully realize the dynamic potentialities
of human utterance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_120" href="#FNanchor_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Unlike many of her sister actresses, Duse made a practice
of reading the criticisms of her acting.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> In 1898 Mme. Vivanti Chartres, one of Duse’s few intimate
friends, said (in the New York <i>Dramatic Mirror</i>):
“Duse’s hatred of publicity and newspaper interviews has assumed
the proportions of a mania.... When we were alone
together, talking of the play I was writing for her, or discussing
modern art, her youthful struggles with poverty, or
the world weariness that came to her finally with her splendid
success, Duse was herself—impulsive, eager, passionate,
tender, sad. But the mere announcement of a visitor would
freeze her into silent hauteur.
</p>
<p>
“I stayed with her in Turin for some time. We used to go
out driving in the <i>Valentino</i> every morning, for Duse said
she needed to begin the day by looking at ‘green things.’ She
was crowding the <i>Teatro Carignano</i>, the receipts averaging
10,000 francs for each performance—a stupendous sum for
Italy. Yes, Duse certainly makes a great deal of money,
but she spends all that she makes. She is exceedingly generous.
One day she gave a magnificent diamond ring to a
dressmaker whom Worth had sent to her from Paris with
her <i>Dame aux Camélias</i> dresses. And she pays her entire
company all the year round, although during the last eighteen
months she has given only twenty-two performances.
</p>
<p>
“At Monte Carlo we stayed at the Victoria, the dullest if
most aristocratic hotel in the place. But Duse has a taste
for the dismal and the melancholy. She is very sad—the
saddest woman I have ever known. She cannot even bear
people’s voices. After the strain of her performance she
drives home quite alone, and sits down to her supper in solitude
and silence. During the days that I was with her we
used to sit at opposite ends of the large table, sometimes without
exchanging half a dozen words, and she used to laugh
her approval across to me when I absolutely refused to answer
her if she made any attempts at polite conversation.
</p>
<p>
“Duse <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">chez elle</i> dresses almost always in white satin. Her
gowns are loose and limp, and folded carelessly around her....
She is a charming woman, highly cultured, sincere, brave
and good. Her conversation, when she chooses to speak, is
startlingly brilliant.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_123" href="#FNanchor_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> It was her rule not to play more than four performances
a week. When she was in her thirties, the world was told
that she was a sufferer from “pulmonary phthisis,” and that
her impending doom was one of the causes of her seclusion
and sadness. All through her career there were periodic reports
of her illness, of canceled engagements and interrupted
tours.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_124" href="#FNanchor_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> “She spends enormous sums on books and photographs,
on bonbons and <em>scissors</em>—a curious hobby of hers, as she buys
pair after pair, which she afterwards loses.... Another of
her fads, which in Italy is a decided novelty, is hygiene; for to
the average Italian mind, the simplest rules of health and
sanitation, even the combination of warmth and good ventilation,
are mysteries, to inquire into which would be useless and
ridiculous. That Duse should like to have a fire and to sit
with the window open at the same time, quite passes their powers of
comprehension.” Helen Zimmern in <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>, 1900.</p></div>

burdened with a sense of intolerable worry, finds herself face
to face with the woman who has supplanted her—would to
a second rate actress prove an irresistible temptation to
frenzied rant; but Duse plays it with a sustained intensity
of controlled detestation and scorn which was infinitely more
impressive, more artistic and more true. In the horrible
climax she leaves details of her destroyed hand to the imagination.”

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_129" href="#FNanchor_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> The name was really Crehan. Why was it changed? Perhaps
because in its original form it was too baldly Irish. Yet
Ada’s two elder sisters had taken to the stage and both appeared
with the name O’Neill. Her mother was Harriet
O’Neill, her father William Crehan. There were six children,
three boys and three girls. The story used to be current that
“Crehan” became “Rehan” through an error of printing; that
when Ada first appeared in Philadelphia, with Mrs. Drew,
she was named on a playbill “Ada C. Rehan”; and that, in
view of the favorable newspaper notices given the new actress,
Mrs. Drew advised her to retain the name inadvertently given
her,—all interesting surely, and perhaps true. Playbills of
the Arch Street Theatre (Philadelphia) of 1874, however, give
“Ada Crehan.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The date of her birth has always been given as April 22,
1860. There are reasons for thinking it must have been earlier.
It would not be the only instance in which an actress’ age has
been reduced by a retroactive manipulation of dates. Her
first appearances on the stage were in 1873 and 1874, and by
the time she went to Daly, in 1879, she had had an extended
experience that would be simply marvelous for a girl of nineteen.
Her hair began to turn gray about 1894. Mr. Winter
says the streaks of gray came prematurely. Of course, they
did, in any event, but thirty-four is an extraordinarily early
age for such a phenomenon in an actress. An anecdote, not
worth repeating, in the <i>Boston Record</i> for November 24, 1888,
is introduced in this way: “Ada Rehan is forty years old and
over. She makes up fairly for girlish rôles ... but at close
sight in the cold light of day she shows her age.” If worthy
of any consideration, this paragraph would place the birthdate
before 1850, obviously going to the other extreme. The
correct date is undoubtedly 1855, or thereabout. Thus she
was about eighteen when, in 1873, she made her first appearance.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_131" href="#FNanchor_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> The eldest, Kate, “had been a choir singer in Limerick, and
while singing at a concert one day in New York was heard by
Harvey Dodworth and invited to join the chorus for Lester
Wallack’s production of the opera of <i>Don Cæsar de Bazan</i>.
She accepted, and was also joined by her younger sister Hattie,
that being the début of the Crehan family upon the stage.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Still, in 1888, when the Daly company was playing in
Paris, several of its members were interviewed, (seemingly
about particularly trivial matters) and Miss Rehan was one
of the talkers. She was said to have been pessimistic about
the wisdom of marriages among actresses, particularly to
actors. This is an ever fresh subject for debate. A writer
in the New York <i>Dramatic Mirror</i>, September 15, 1888, wrote
a column to refute Miss Rehan’s remarks.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_140" href="#FNanchor_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> Mary Young, herself a member of Daly’s Company, in a
talk to the Drama League of Boston in 1914, said: “Mr.
Daly was a most polite gentleman, with extraordinary eyes
of green, as clear and sharp as they were kind and laughing;
wonderful, all-seeing eyes!... The strictest discipline
reigned everywhere. Every member, with the exception of
Miss Rehan, seemed to be in a state of complete terror. Mr.
Daly was supreme and held his company of distinguished
players with a grip of iron. Rules and regulations were
posted everywhere. One or two that I recall were: ‘The
way to succeed—mind your own business,’ and ‘How to be
happy—keep your mouth shut.’ I was amazed to see some
of the extra girls hide behind pieces of scenery rather than
face those remarkable eyes that might be cast their way as
Mr. Daly was casually passing from one part of the stage to
another.... However, to my mind he was a just man, although
his temper often caused him to seem to do unjust
things.... His heart was kind and he could not treasure up
a wrong against any one who had once gained his confidence
and respect.”
</p>
<p>
C. M. S. McLellan, who nowadays writes “books” for
operettas, (and who wrote <i>Leah Kleschna</i> for Mrs. Fiske) in
1888 was writing for the New York <i>Press</i> what passed for
amusing comment on theatrical matters. His chatter about
Mr. Daly and Miss Rehan does a little toward characterizing
both: “At the stage door you find a bulldog. Mr. Daly secluded
himself in a padded room at the end of a secret passage.
He comes down to the dog kennel to freeze all reporters.
Editors are invited up to the green room. Henry Irving is
supposed to be the only man who ever penetrated to the padded
chamber, and he tells the story that while he was there Mr.
Daly opened a bottle of claret and smiled. The claret part of
the story is generally credited, but unless Mr. Irving is degenerating
in his choice of words we think there was some
mistake about the smile.
</p>
<p>
“But if any of us ever had doubts concerning the healthfully
hilarious influence exerted by Mr. Daly’s benignity upon a
great comedy company we have only to glance at Miss Rehan
and be converted. We have had that baby pout of hers in
opera and in Shakespeare, that imperious, uplifted nose of
hers in Jenny O’Jones and Helena, and as the snows of
various cycles descend on the heads of her worshipers the
musical purr of the Rehan still sings the third sweet song
of seven. And when she smiles, the light of pearls and
rubies creeps out and illumines the nooks that the calcium
cannot penetrate.
</p>
<p>
“So why should not Mr. Daly live in a padded room and
manage the electric buttons that blush all this youth and divine
color across a befogged community? He is entitled to
padded rooms, bulldogs and cold hands. If he does nothing
for the next forty years but keep the crack of doom out of
Rehan’s purr he will have earned the right to be made Sheriff
of New York County.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> “Ada Rehan is of a superior race of women. She can
be enormously interesting simply standing looking out of a
window, her back to the audience, immobile, but with a
‘calmness’ that sends off vibrations that stir the pulses very
curiously, and make her always the magnet, the center.
She pauses, but it is the pause of a fine balance of strong
feelings. She is all alive; she whirls round and comes into
the action with a bold ringing stroke that has been adjudged
to perfection. She can stride—not like a man, for she is
always a fine woman—but like the daughter of Fingal, the
sister of Ossian. She can bang a door like a chord of martial
music. She can precipitate herself headlong into a room, and
seizing her opponent or her lover, for she is equal to all occasions,
at the critical wavering movement, sweep in with
a wrestler’s power and lift him metaphorically helpless off
his feet. Yet in all these displays Rehan is never violent in
a narrow way, or streaky, or hard, or wiry.... The beauty
of repose is delightful in her, the calm musing meditation,
and the deep harmonious passion of devotion; so also is the
quick salient swerve of emotion wherein the soul is suddenly
shaken to its depths by love, by fear, by admiration ... we
find life and flesh and blood throughout, and everywhere the
fire of the soul that animates it.” Arthur Lynch, in <i>Human

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> “Playing Katherine brought me much satisfaction, but a

lines were written, and Miss Rehan’s art may—nay, must—have
ripened in the interval. I try to persuade myself that
I may not have been so far wrong after all, but it won’t do....
There must have been beauties in the performance of six

Theatre, Boston, (on September 24, 1894) where many interesting
events have taken place. Here Julia Marlowe, six
years before, had won her first really genuine recognition.
The Hollis Street Theatre was first opened in 1885, and is
still often referred to as the best-equipped theatre (on the
stage) in the country. It was built in the site of the old
Hollis Street Church, where John Pierpont, grandfather of
John Pierpont Morgan, and Thomas Starr King preached.
The walls of the church building of 1808 were incorporated
in the theatre. The opening attraction was <i>The Mikado</i>. In
the course of its run of twenty weeks Richard Mansfield appeared

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Mary Anderson was the child of a devout Catholic mother,
her brief period of schooling was in Catholic schools, her beloved
Pater Anton was of course a strong influence for her
adherence to that faith, and, throughout her public life and
since, her devotion to her church has been constant and
earnest. One of her friends (Henry Watterson) expressed the
conviction that to her religion she owed much of the fortitude
that carried her through the ordeals and failures of her career.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> “The convent was a large, Italian-looking building, surrounded
by gardens and shut in by high, prison-like walls.
That first night in the long dormitory, with its rows of
white beds and their little occupants, some as sad as myself,
my grief seemed more than I could bear. The moon made a
track of light across the floor. A strain of soft music came
in at the open window; it was only an accordion, played by
someone sitting outside the convent wall; but how sweet and
soothing it was! The simple little melody seemed to say:
‘See what a friend I can be! I am music sent from heaven to
cheer and console. Love me, and I will soothe and calm your
heart when it is sad, and double all your joys.’ It kept saying
such sweet things to me that soon I fell asleep, and
dreamed I was at home again. From that moment I felt
music a panacea for all my childhood’s sorrows.”—Mary Anderson,

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> While a mere girl, Mary learned to ride a horse. Twice
a year a visit was made to an Indiana farm. She learned
to ride spirited horses without saddle or bridle. Riding
was always her favorite amusement. Long afterwards, in
London, a riding-master once said to her: “Why, Miss Handerson,
you ’ave missed your vocation. What a hexcellent
circus hactor you would ’ave made! I’d like to see the ’orse
as could throw you now.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_152" href="#FNanchor_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> One who was present told William Winter “that notwithstanding
the conditions inseparable from youth and inexperience,
it was a performance of extraordinary fire, feeling
and promise. Its paramount beauty, he said, was its vocalism.
Miss Anderson’s voice, indeed, was always her predominant
charm. Certain tones of it—so thrilling, so full
of wild passion and inexpressible melancholy—went straight
to the heart, and brought tears into the eyes.”—<i>Other Days.</i>
</p>
<p>
Throughout her career all observers noted the richness and
expressiveness of Mary Anderson’s voice, especially its thrilling
lower tones. After she retired from the stage, indeed, she
paid considerable attention to singing, and once sang in public,
in a small way, for charity.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> Henry Watterson, the journalist of Louisville and one of
Miss Anderson’s earliest friends and advisers, tells this story
to indicate the self-reliance that was the cue to her success:
“On one occasion, after a long discussion, the counselor
whom she had sought, quite worn out with his failure to convince
her, exclaimed with some irritation: ‘Don’t you know
that I am double your age, and have gone over all this ground,
and can’t be mistaken?’ ‘No,’ she coolly replied, ‘I don’t
know anything I have not gone over myself.’ She considered
everything that was relevant, consulted everybody who could
give information, and decided for herself.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_154" href="#FNanchor_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> It was during this engagement, that the young actress

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_155" href="#FNanchor_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> It does Mary Anderson nothing but credit to point out that
at the time she was first claiming the attention of the East
she had not yet grown to be quite the Mary Anderson the
world remembers. She was already beautiful, but she was as
yet a comparatively friendless, inexperienced young girl, ignorant
of much of the art of the theatre and with undeveloped
taste in dress; yet self-confident and perhaps just a bit spoiled.
The manager of the theatre at which she played her first engagement
in New York (in November, 1877) long afterward
remembered its details. On the opening night “there was
about three hundred dollars in money and a good paper
house. Never was a Pauline attired in such execrable taste.
The ladies of the audience could not conceal their smiles; but
in the cottage scene Miss Anderson’s fine voice and her beauty
captured everybody. Other plays followed. As Parthenia
she looked a picture in her simple costume, and her manner
of saying ‘I go to cleanse the cup’ enchanted the audience. As
Bianca in <i>Fazio</i> she wore modern costumes, and but for her
youthful beauty would have been absurd.
</p>
<p>
“On the first night, after the performance, I started home
for supper, when it occurred to me that perhaps Miss Anderson
would like something to eat after her hard work. So I
called at Dr. Griffin’s rooms in West Twenty-eighth Street and
found the future Queen of Tragedy eating a cold pork chop
as she sat on a trunk. The whole party accepted my invitation
and we went to the nearest restaurant. On our way we
passed a candy store and Mary looked so longingly at the
window that I asked whether she would like some candy.
‘Oh, yes!’ she cried, and jumped up and down on the pavement
with pleasure. She selected a pound of molasses cream
drops and commenced to eat them at once. The supper began
with oysters on the half shell. To see Mary Anderson eat
oysters and candy alternately was terrible; but a handsome
girl may do anything unrebuked.
</p>
<p>
“The papers were very kind to Miss Anderson during her
first engagement. She made a success of youth and loveliness;
but the public did not rush in to see her.
</p>
<p>
“After a while, Henry Watterson, who had known her in
Louisville, came to town and took an interest in her. He
brought with him ex-Governor Tilden, who was taken behind
the scenes to be introduced to the new star. He whispered
to me, ‘What a remarkably handsome girl! No actress,
but how very handsome!’”</p></div>

was not adapted to her, she declined it. Gilbert amusingly
asked her if this was because she found anything gross in it.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> It would be an impertinence to doubt the good faith of
Mary Anderson’s own statement as to the immediate cause of
her retirement in March, 1889. It is nevertheless interesting
to observe that at the time, and later, the newspapers freely
discussed circumstances which do not enter into her account.
One theory was that adverse critical comment, which was
found in many reviews of her acting, disturbed her seriously,
and preyed more and more upon her mind until she lost faith
in her own power, and underwent in consequence a somewhat
severe nervous prostration. There was even a wide-spread
report that she became mildly insane,—which was promptly
discredited and which was of course merely a piece of sensationalism.
Particular mention is made of one Louisville critic
who, during Miss Anderson’s early years was one of her
friends and advisers, but who, when she returned at the height
of her career, sincerely believed her spoiled and a much less
fine actress than she had given promise of becoming. He
therefore wrote a frank and fearless analysis of her acting,
in which he found much to dispraise. It is impossible to tell
with accuracy how much truth there is in this story. Miss
Anderson herself says that it was never her habit to read
newspaper criticisms of her work, except that someone kept
for her those that might prove helpful and that these were
used as possible hints when she began work another season.</p></div>

cannot imagine. Upon revisiting in her professional tours the
scenes of her childhood days one would naturally expect a
great actress to remark, ‘Here is where I made my first appearance,’
or ‘Here I played the Widow Melnotte when I was
only twelve’; but I do not recall that I ever heard Mrs. Fiske
make the slightest allusion to persons or places, with one or
two exceptions. She was appearing at Robinson’s Opera
House, Cincinnati. As she entered the dressing room on the
opening night she glanced about, and then at me, as if to determine
whether or not it was safe to intrust me with the information.
She then remarked that when a child she was
brought into that room to see Mary Anderson in reference to
playing some child character in one of Miss Anderson’s plays,—<i>Ingomar</i>,

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_167" href="#FNanchor_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> “The extraordinary thing about Mrs. Fiske’s early career
is that she should have been even <em>permitted</em> to play the range
of characters that she did.... Frequently a young woman
who is physically well developed easily passes for a much
older person, and the eye is satisfied even if the ear be not,
but little Minnie <em>was</em> little, and held her audiences then by
her genius, as she subsequently has continued to do.”—Griffith.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_168" href="#FNanchor_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> It is of this period that Mildred Aldrich wrote, in her
article on Mrs. Fiske in <i>Famous American Actors of To-day</i>:
“It was twilight on a very cold day when I knocked at her
room at Hotel Vendome. A clear voice bade me enter and in
a moment I had forgotten my cold drive. It was a voice which
I can never forget, and which even as I write of it comes to
my ear with a strange delicious insistence. As the door closed
behind me there rose from the depths of a large chair, and
stood between me and the dim light from the window a slender,
childish figure, in a close-fitting, dark gown. The fading light,
the dark dress, threw into greater relief the pale face with its
small features and deep eyes, above and around which, like a
halo, was a wealth of curling red hair. I had been told that
she was young; but I was not prepared for any such unique
personality as hers, and I still remember the sensation of the
surprise she was to me as a most delightful experience. This
was not the conventional young actress to whom I have been
accustomed; this slight, undeveloped figure, in its straight,
girlish gown reaching only to the slender ankles. There was
a pretty assumption of dignity; there was a constant cropping
out in bearing, in speech, in humor and in gestures of
delicious, inimitable, unconcealable youth which was most
fetching and which had something so infinitely touching in it.
</p>
<p>
“I have never encountered a face more variable. At one
moment I would think her beautiful. The next instant a
quick turn of the head would give me a different view of the
face and I would say to myself, ‘She is plain’; then she would
speak, and that beautiful musical <i xml:lang="it" lang="it">mezzo</i>, so uncommon to
American ears, and from which a Boston man once emotionally
declared ‘feeling could be positively wrung, so over-saturated
was it,’ would touch my heart and all else would be forgotten.
Such was Minnie Maddern when I first met her on her eighteenth
birthday.”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_169" href="#FNanchor_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> This was not her first marriage. She had been married
when she was about sixteen to LeGrand White, a musician and
theatrical manager. They were divorced about two years before
she married Mr. Fiske.
</p>
<p>
“For two years before her marriage [to Mr. Fiske] she had
been continually worried with the theatre and her rest was a
welcome one. She had many interests beside the stage, and
loved to get away to a little cottage, at Larchmont, where she
took an active part in all the doings, and where she was a
familiar figure driving a little yellow cart madly over the
roads, more often bare headed than not, and always with that
wonderful red hair flying in the wind.”—Mildred Aldrich.</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_170" href="#FNanchor_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> The list of productions beginning with Mrs. Fiske’s return

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_174" href="#FNanchor_174" class="fnanchor">174</a> In 1907 Mrs. Fiske took <i>The New York Idea</i> on an unprecedented
tour throughout the West. She played not only
as far South as the Mexican border, and along the Pacific
coast, but even went into the Canadian Northwest as far as
Edmonton, appearing in many towns that had never before
seen a theatrical company of the highest grade. And <i>The New
York Idea</i>, a sophisticated comedy addressed to Eastern audiences,
was successful everywhere. At Globe, Arizona, the
audience contained hundreds who had come from long distances
by train, stage or horse-back. Calgary demanded a return engagement.
At Edmonton the play was given in a rink on an
improvised stage, and lasted from eleven o’clock—the time
of the arrival of the belated train—till two of the early
northern dawn.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> “There never was a case of lame or scurvy dog that fell
under Mrs. Fiske’s notice that did not get instant relief. A
mangy and ownerless mongrel cur on the street never failed to
find a friend in her. If she were in a carriage, no conveyance
was too good for Towser or Tige. Towser or Tige might never
have had a bath during all of his unhappy dog days, but into
the carriage went the friend of man, and the coachman was
directed to steer for the nearest veterinarian, who was forthwith
subsidized to make a good dog out of a very much
frazzled one, and send the bill to Mrs. Fiske. All over this
glorious country dogs were being repaired, boarded, and rebuilt
as good as new, when masters were adopted for them,
and ‘the dog that Mrs. Fiske saved’ lived his allotted span
and expired loved, honored, and respected. With horses, too,
it was just the same. I believe if she were on the way to a
matinée with the house all sold out, and an abused or otherwise
pitiful case of horse attracted her attention,—and it
<em>would</em>—she would sacrifice that matinée before she would the
horse.”—Griffith.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_176" href="#FNanchor_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Mrs. Fiske at one time was fond of visiting the motion-picture
theatres, heavily veiled and sitting in the back of the
house. The better grade of foreign films interested her. And
she has recently shown more broad-mindedness toward a growing
art than some actresses much lower than she in the artistic
scale; for she has herself recently acted <i>Tess</i> and <i>Becky Sharp</i>
for the motion-picture camera.
</p>
<p>
“When attending another theatre, as she sometimes does
on a Wednesday afternoon, she would like, if she could, to
occupy an obscure balcony seat, or at the back downstairs;
but if that is not feasible, and a box must be taken, she generally
ensconces herself behind the drapery, in as inconspicuous
a place as possible. There is absolutely nothing of the spectacular
or ‘theatrical’ about Mrs. Fiske.”—Griffith.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_177" href="#FNanchor_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> “During a rehearsal her poodle entered the theatre and
calmly and unconsciously crossed the stage, keeping at a respectful
distance from her, however, only condescending to
notice her mistress with a side glance. This was so contrary
to her customary dashing and bounding approach, that Mrs.
Fiske stopped the rehearsal and called to Fifi to come to her.
But not Fifi; she merely glanced and continued her dignified
and stately promenade across the stage. Persistently and
with authority Mrs. Fiske ordered the queenly Fifi to approach.
Not for Hecuba—no approach, only a pause. Mohammed
must go to the mountain, and Mrs. Fiske did the approaching.
Did Fifi grin, or what did the slight gleam of
white teeth portend? It was merely the flash of lightning,
for the thunder came soon after in a low growl of defiance.
Never had such a thing happened before. This impromptu
play was good, with Mrs. Fiske at her best, and the audience
of actors stood by immensely interested. With tragic emphasis
Mrs. Fiske stamped her foot and, pointing in the direction
of her dressing room, ordered the black woolly beast to
begone and quit her sight, to let the dressing room hide her,
and a few things like that, and added something about Fifi’s
bones being marrowless and her blood cold, and about the
absence of speculation in her eyes which she did glare with.
Just then Mr. Gilmore remarked: ‘That’s not Fifi—that’s my
dog Genie.’ Laughter—quick curtain.”—Griffith.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_178" href="#FNanchor_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> “When a series of one-night stands was being played—and
she has a perfectly frantic fondness for them—it was our custom
to charter a Pullman, as she lived in the car instead of
in hotels.... This she most urgently requested to have
placed ‘<em>not</em> at the end of the train.’ The rear-end collision
had mortal terrors for her.... The same nervous fear applied
to non-fireproof hotels, in any of which Mrs. Fiske will
not go above the second story.... Mrs. Fiske appears never
to weary of travel, and while she objects to starts ranging
from five to ten o’clock <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, an earlier or later leaving hour
does not disturb her; in fact, she says she rarely falls asleep
until near morning. We had a prohibition against ringing the
berth bells before ten <span class="smcap smaller">A.M.</span>, and also against any kind of
alarm clock.... Very rarely Mrs. Fiske went to the dining
car in the train, her dislike for making herself conspicuous
being very marked. This modesty was exemplified in her
fondness for veils, as she always wore at least one, and more
generally two.... Her unceasing employment of time when
on tour is in study. It is a never-ending labor, and one that
evidently delights her. The preparation for things to come—perhaps
a year or more ahead—is always in her mind....
During all my time [thirteen years] with Mrs. Fiske she never
lost a single night from illness.”—Griffith.</p></div>

Miss Marlowe. There was no actual relationship; but by
legal agreement or otherwise Miss Marlowe was an
“adopted niece” of the older woman. Miss Dow’s interest
in her young charge was, naturally, not wholly altruistic.
That is, there was a signed agreement by virtue of which
Miss Dow was to share heavily in any earnings of Miss
Marlowe for a term of years after the début, and was to
have a voice in the management of her affairs. After the
actress’ emergence in 1887 as Julia Marlowe, however, Miss
Dow’s management continued for only a few years. There
was even newspaper talk of Miss Marlowe’s having “thrown
over” her guide and friend, after she began to meet success.
Miss Dow became Mrs. Currier. Her training of Fanny
Brough started her on a long career as a dramatic teacher,
in which capacity she was active as recently as the autumn
of 1915.</p></div>

balcony rail. With her chin resting upon it and her gaze
fixed tenderly upon a worn place in the carpet, she first recited
Juliet’s impassioned good-night to her lover.”</p></div>

important day of her life? The date of her birth has been
variously given, and authority might be found for any year
between 1864 and 1870. As a matter of fact, the Register of
Baptisms of the Parish of Caldbeck shows that she was baptized
September 23, 1866. Thus she was at least twenty-one
at the time of her début, though she was popularly supposed
to be about eighteen.</p></div>

the freshness that is her greatest charm she will have to ...
pay no attention to the critics. Her talent needs no guide
save that afforded by her experience and her own mentality.”
One Alfred Ayres, writing to the editor of the New York
<i>Dramatic Mirror</i>, voiced the protest that was felt in many
quarters against Colonel Ingersoll’s kindly meant over-enthusiasm:
“What nonsense clever men do sometimes talk,
when they talk about things they know little or nothing
about!... There is not a novice in America more in need
of guidance than is Miss Julia Marlowe. To let her go her
own way would be to let her go to ruin. She is already
on the high-road to becoming merely coy, coddling, and goody-goody.”
Colonel Ingersoll became Miss Marlowe’s personal
friend. At least one summer she spent with his family.</p></div>

September 19, 1904, at the Illinois Theatre. It continued for
three seasons, after which, during the seasons of 1907–8 and
1908–9, each again headed separate companies. In 1909 they
rejoined forces, and continued to act together until the spring
of 1914, when Miss Marlowe was taken sick, and Mr. Sothern
continued alone. At this time it was announced that Miss
Marlowe had retired from the stage for good. There was
subsequently some talk of a farewell tour, but Miss Marlowe’s
retirement was definitely confirmed in the summer of 1915.

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_193" href="#FNanchor_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> Mr. Walkley wrote in <i>The Times</i> an eloquent tribute to
her Viola, which he found “bewitching.” “In the purely sensuous
element in Shakespeare, in the poet’s picture of frankly
joyous and full-blooded womanhood, the actress is in her element,
mistress of her part, revelling in it and swaying the
audience by an irresistible charm. She aims at no startling
‘effects’; she seems to be simply herself—herself, that is, glorified
by the romance of the part—enjoying the moment for the
moment’s sake, and so making the moment a sheer enjoyment
for the spectator. That is now clearly shown which in her
earlier parts could only be divined—that here is a genuine individuality,
a temperament of real force and peculiar charm.
High-arched brows over wide-open, eloquent eyes; a most expressive
mouth, now roguish with mischief, now trembling with
passion; a voice with a strange croon in it, with sudden breaks
and sobs—these, of course, are purely physical qualifications
which an actress might have and yet not greatly move us.
But behind these things in Miss Marlowe there is evidently
an alert intelligence, a rare sense of humor and a nervous
energy which make, with her more external qualities, a combination
really fine. She beguiled not only Olivia, but the
whole house to admiration. Here, then, is one of Shakespeare’s
true women.”</p></div>

of a piquant behavior, Miss Adams was a sprightly and bonnie

“There used to be an old doorkeeper at the stage entrance of the
Empire Theatre. One day he was taken sick and his place was
filled by another. Miss Adams learned that the old chap had
lost his position and made a hurried search for him, tracing
him, at last, to an East Side tenement. It was long after midnight
when she found him. He was very ill and was being
taken care of by his faithful wife as best she could. Doctors
and nurses were immediately summoned and every possible
comfort provided; and the next morning, and the next, and the
next came Lady Bountiful—and every day, until the sufferer
died a month later.

“For sixteen years Robert Eberle was in Charles Frohman’s
employ as business manager. One year, late in the season, he
was taken ill and left in a hospital in South Bend, Indiana.
Miss Adams was playing in the West at the time, and hearing
of Mr. Eberle’s illness—though several hundred miles from the
hospital—left her company on Saturday night, went to South
Bend, spent Sunday at the sick man’s bedside, and, leaving
orders for the best of medical treatment, returned to her work
just in time to dress for her part on Monday night.”</p></div>

appeared in France probably not much later. The earliest
French actress of whom there is definite record is Marie
Vernier, who acted in Paris, in her husband’s company, in
1599. In Spain the practice of substituting boys and men in
women’s parts seems never to have obtained. Going back
to antiquity, it is to be noted that while the Greeks never
tolerated actresses on their stage, in Rome occasional women
players were by no means unknown.</p></div>

the restrictions placed by Cromwell’s government on the
theatres, by devising a species of opera. They were really
plays, in the grand style, modeled after Italian pieces, and
with a musical accompaniment to take the curse off. In one
of these, <i>The Siege of Rhodes</i>, performed in 1656, two
women, Mrs. Edward Coleman and another, played Ianthe
and Roxalana.</p></div>

“Old Chetwood tells a story which amply illustrates the
absurdity of the ‘men-actresses.’ King Charles II, he says,
coming to the theatre to see <i>Hamlet</i> and being kept waiting
for some time, sent the Earl of Rochester behind to see what
was causing the delay. He returned with the information
that ‘the Queen was not quite shaved.’ ‘Odsfish!’ said the
King. ‘I beg her Majesty’s pardon. We’ll wait till her
barber has done with her.’”—Lowe’s <i>Betterton</i>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_226" href="#FNanchor_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> As seems clear, for instance, from Hamlet’s unusual
consideration of them. The often-quoted law enacted in the
reigns of Elizabeth and James seems, however, to have been
directed not against the established city companies, but
against the wandering country players. It reads, quaintly
enough: “All bear-wards, common players of interludes,
counterfeit Egyptians, etc., shall be taken, adjudged, and
deemed Rogues and Vagabonds and Sturdy Beggars, and
shall sustain all pain and punishment as by this act is in that
behalf appointed.” For a résumé of the phases of the actor’s
lack of social position see John Fyvie’s “Comedy Queens of
the Eighteenth Century.”</p></div>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_227" href="#FNanchor_227" class="fnanchor">227</a> “Of course, in the theatrical profession, as in every other,
there have always been exceptional individuals whose characters
and abilities (especially if they managed to acquire a
little wealth) have raised them into the highest society of
their time. But in the case of actors it was always quite
apparent that they were only there in sufferance, and were
tolerated because they were amusing. It was thought a
stinging satire, for example, when ‘Junius,’ incidentally addressing
Garrick, wrote: ‘Now mark me, <em>vagabond</em>; keep to
your pantomimes or be assured you shall hear of it.’”</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_228" href="#FNanchor_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> “Goldsmith having said, that Garrick’s compliment to the
Queen, which he introduced into the play of <i>The Chances</i>,
which he had altered and revised this year, was mean and
gross flattery; Johnson: ‘... as to meanness (rising into
warmth), how is it mean in a player—a showman—a fellow
who exhibits himself for a shilling, to flatter his queen?’
(1773).

<p>
“He (Foote) mentioned, that an Irish gentleman said to
Johnson, ‘Sir, you have not seen the best French players.’
Johnson: ‘Players, Sir! I look on them as no better than
creatures set upon tables and joint-stools to make faces and
produce laughter, like dancing dogs.’—‘But, Sir, you will
allow that some players are better than others?’ Johnson:
‘Yes, Sir, as some dogs dance better than others.’ (1775).
</p>
<p>
“I wondered (said Johnson) to find Richardson displeased
that I ‘did not treat Cibber with more <em>respect</em>. Now, Sir,
to talk of <em>respect</em> for a <em>player</em>’ (smiling disdainfully). Boswell:
‘There, Sir, you are always heretical; you never will
allow merit to a player.’ Johnson: ‘Merit, Sir, what merit?
Do you respect a rope-dancer, or a ballad-singer?’ Boswell:
‘No, Sir; but we respect a great player, as a man who can
conceive lofty sentiments, and can express them gracefully.’
Johnson: ‘What, Sir, a fellow who claps a hump on his back,
and a lump on his leg, and cries, “I am Richard the Third”?’”

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
